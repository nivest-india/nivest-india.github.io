### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Bajaj Finance Limited (BAJFINANCE) |
| **Sector** | NBFC - Consumer Finance |
| **Current Price** | ₹894 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹5,55,868 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-23 |

### Industry Overview

- Large, underpenetrated consumer-credit market in India with secular tailwinds from digital distribution, financial inclusion, and rising consumer credit penetration.
- NBFCs face structural benefits (speed, product variety) but are exposed to funding-market cycles and RBI/market regulatory scrutiny.
- Key demand drivers over 3-5 years: digitisation (open-banking/AA), payments adoption (UPI/ONDC), affordable housing and small-ticket consumer financing.
- Primary risks: macro slowdown impacting MSME & auto, interest-rate/funding shocks, and increasing competition from banks/fintechs.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | 10-12% annual credit growth (system); consumer/AUM digitisation faster |
| Market Size | Credit market ~₹200+ Lakh Cr (addressable segments large); Bajaj AUM ₹4.17 Lakh Cr (FY25) |
| Sector Tailwinds | Digital adoption, partnerships (Airtel), rising retail credit share |
| Sector Headwinds | Cyclical MSME/auto stress, funding volatility, regulatory tightening |
| Policy Support | Positive (financial inclusion, fintech rails); NBFC oversight stronger |
| Competition Level | High |
| Technology Disruption | Positive (AI, platform plays) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Consumer/retail NBFCs are well-placed to capture structural credit demand; Bajaj benefits from scale and digital distribution.  
- Near-term headwinds (MSME stress, auto slowdown) moderate outlook but do not negate secular tailwinds.  
- Technology (FINAI) and distribution partnerships materially increase addressable market; execution risk remains.

#### Financial Strength: 6/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------:|----------:|
| Debt-to-Equity | 3.74 | (NBFC: compare vs peers) |
| Interest Coverage | 1.89x | >2.5x (Good) |
| Free Cash Flow (TTM) | ≈ -₹69,200 Cr (negative) | Positive preferred |
| Current Ratio | 3.18 | >1.2 (Good) |
| Quick Ratio | 3.18 | >1.0 (Good) |
| Net Debt (approx) | ₹347,705 Cr (Borrowings ₹361,249 Cr - Cash ₹13,544 Cr) | Lower better |
| Cash & Equivalents | ₹13,544 Cr | Higher is better |
| Liquidity Buffer | ~₹14,000 Cr+ (FY25 Q1 disclosure) | Strong buffer |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strengths: very strong capital adequacy (CRAR ~21.9%), large liquidity buffer, substantial retail deposit pool (~19% of borrowings) and strong cash & investment holdings. Operating cash flows are negative due to lending growth (working capital absorption) — typical for rapidly growing finance companies but FCF negative remains a structural point to monitor.  
- Concerns: leverage is high (Debt/Equity ~3.7) — standard for NBFCs but materially above non-financial benchmarks; interest coverage (1.89x) is below the 2.5x comfort threshold (indicates tight debt service cushion if stress rises).  
- Net-debt remains large; however, investment/inventory of liquid assets partially mitigates funding risk. Overall balance-sheet is well-capitalised but carries sensitivity to funding-cost moves and credit shocks.

#### Valuations: 5/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg | Historical Avg |
|-------------------|--------:|---------:|---------------:|
| P/E Ratio | 31.9x | 22.8x (median peers) | - |
| P/B Ratio | 5.75x | 1.86x (median peers) | - |
| EV/EBITDA | 18.0x | 12.5x (median peers) | - |
| Market Cap / Sales | 8.0x (approx) | - | - |
| PEG Ratio | Elevated (P/E vs growth) | - | - |
| EV/Sales | Elevated | - | - |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Stock trades at a premium vs NBFC peer medians on P/E and especially on P/BV. Premium reflects high ROE, superior growth history, strong franchise and liquidity.  
- Current multiples already price a significant part of execution-led earnings improvement (FINAI, deposit mix improvement). Valuation leaves limited margin for disappointment on credit-costs or execution.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------:|------:|
| ROE | 19.2% (FY25) |
| ROCE | 11.4% |
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | ~30% |
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | ~21% |
| AUM Growth (FY25) | +26% YoY (AUM ₹4,16,661 Cr → FY25) |
| CAPEX | Tech & AI investments (FY26 guidance: modest; digital platform capex) |
| Dividend Payout | ~21% (FY25 special + final) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High historical AUM and profit CAGRs (20-30% range) and an aggressive digital/customer-acquisition engine support continued growth.  
- Management guidance FY26: AUM growth ~24-25%, customer adds 14-16 Mn — credible given distribution and partnerships.  
- Execution risk: MSME/auto stress may slow growth in specific lines; however new verticals (gold loans, mortgage, broking, payments) and AI-led productivity are strong offsets.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | 4 per year + investor meets |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Clear (BFL 3.0 / FINAI roadmap) |
| Management Communication | High (detailed concall transcripts & presentations) |
| Governance Score | 8/10 |
| Transparency Rating | High |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | ~0.49% (FY25 final + special) |
| Dividend History | Regular dividend + special dividends in FY25 |
| Recent Buyback | None recently |
| Capital Allocation | QIP + BHFL IPO + Bonus 4:1 and split (June 2025) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High disclosure standards, frequent concalls, detailed investor presentations and a clear multi-year tech/transformation plan. Succession event (MD resignation; Rajeev Jain appointed VC & MD) was handled transparently and promptly.  
- Shareholder-friendly actions (bonus, dividends) reflect strong capital position but dilute near-term per-share metrics; governance is generally strong.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Average Broker Target | ~₹980–1,000 |
| Current Price | ₹894 |
| Upside vs CMP (avg) | ~+10–12% |
| Buy Recommendations | Majority (several buy/neutral) |
| Consensus Rating | Buy / Neutral |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent broker coverage generally positive (targets ~₹980–1,000), reflecting confidence in medium-term earnings recovery and AUM growth. Some brokers flag valuation as high — hence mix of BUY/HOLD. Research supports growth thesis but flags asset-quality risk.

#### Technical Analysis & Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Period | Return | vs Nifty (approx) |
|--------|-------:|------------------:|
| 1 Month | -6.2% | Underperform |
| 3 Month | -3.3% | Mixed |
| 6 Month | +6.5% | Outperform |
| 1 Year | +32.8% | Outperform |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| 50-DMA | ₹902 (approx) |
| 200-DMA | ₹852 (approx) |
| Volume Trend | Healthy, episodic spikes on corporate news |
| RSI (14) | Neutral (~52) |

| Market Sentiment & Near-term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| News Sentiment | Neutral-to-Positive (Q1 FY26 results, leadership change handled) |
| Social Media Buzz | Medium |
| Options Activity | Neutral to slightly bullish historically around quarterly results |
| Upcoming Events | Q2 earnings, policy / RBI moves, FY26 guidance updates |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Technicals show a strong uptrend over 1 year; short-term consolidation after strong run-up. Volume profile supports institutional participation. Near-term events (earnings, policy rate moves) will drive short-term volatility.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 9/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % (Jun 2025) | Previous % | Change |
|---------------------|---------------------:|-----------:|-------:|
| Promoter Holding | 54.73% | ~54.7% | Stable |
| FII Holding | 21.71% | ↑ | Up modestly |
| DII Holding | 14.52% | ↑ | Up modestly |
| Public Holding | 8.92% | ↓ | Slight decline |
| Pledged Shares | 0.00% | 0.00% | No pledge |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | Presence of sovereign/large global funds (Government of Singapore entities historically among top FII holders) |
| Recent Changes | Institutional inflows (FIIs/DII) steady in 2025 |
| Promoter Pledge | None (positive) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong promoter commitment (major stake), institutional interest (FIIs/DII), no promoter pledge. Quality of investor base and stable promoter holding are positive governance & stability factors.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Valuation vs. Peers | Premium | P/E ~31.9x vs peer median ~22.8x; P/B ~5.8 vs peer median ~1.9x — premium justified by franchise, ROE and growth, but leaves little margin for miss. |
| Performance vs. Peers | Superior | Higher AUM growth, superior ROE (≈19%), better cross-sell metrics and digital reach compared with most NBFC peers. |

---

## Key Strengths
- Market-leading retail NBFC with large, rapidly growing AUM (₹4.16 Lakh Cr FY25) and a 100M+ customer franchise trajectory.  
- Strong capital position (CRAR ~21.9%), healthy liquidity buffer and progressive deposit mobilisation.  
- High operating leverage potential from FINAI (AI-first) program and partnerships (Airtel) — structural margin/efficiency upside.  
- Low reported GNPA/NNPA historically (sub-1% GNPA) and strong early-stage vintage control relative to peers.  
- Clean promoter holding, no pledge, active institutional ownership, shareholder-friendly corporate actions (bonus, dividends).

## Key Concerns
- Elevated leverage and low interest-coverage (~1.89x) create sensitivity to funding-cost increases.  
- Credit-costs trending above historical lows (FY25 elevated provisions; MSME & 2W/3W pockets showing stress).  
- Rich valuation (P/B and P/E premium) — high execution bar for management to deliver expected returns.  
- Free cash flow negative (large lending growth consumes cash) — FCF improvement depends on stable funding and asset-quality normalisation.  
- Regional/industry concentrations (MSME exposures, political/regulatory risk in select states) need continued monitoring.

## Scenario Analysis

### Summary assumptions used across scenarios
- CMP = ₹894 (as of 2025-08-23). Dividend yield assumed ~0.5% for 12 months based on recent payouts.
- Base metrics referenced: FY25 consolidated AUM ₹4,16,661 Cr; ROE ~19%; GNPA ~0.96%; guided FY26 AUM growth 24-25%; credit-cost guidance 1.85-1.95% (management).

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | AUM growth FY26: 28-30% (accelerated adoption + Airtel partnership); Credit cost falls to 1.2-1.5% (vintage improvement, quick cycle-out of stressed auto book); NIM +20-30 bps (cheaper funding, deposit mix); ROE expands to 20.5–22%; EPS grows ~25-30% YoY. Valuation multiple re-rates to P/B ~9 / P/E ~36 (multiple expansion as execution and RoE sustain). |
| **Catalysts** | Faster cost-of-funds decline, meaningful FINAI productivity benefits (opex/NTI down 40-50 bps), outperformance in mortgage & gold loans, strong Q2/Q3 asset-quality prints. |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,400 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 15% |
| **Justification** | Achievable only with a combination of margin expansion, large credit-cost improvement and multiple re-rating; limited probability given elevated starting valuation and macro risk. |

### Base Case (Most Likely)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | AUM growth FY26: 24-25% (management guidance); Credit cost moderate at 1.85-1.95%; NIM stable (±10 bps); ROE ~19-20%; EPS growth ~15-20%. Valuation holds or compresses modestly to P/B ~6.7 (market prices in growth but not full re-rating). |
| **Execution Milestones** | Continued customer additions (14-16 Mn), deposit mix improvement to lower COF, early FINAI benefits (opex ratio improvements visible), staged improvement in Stage-2 flows. |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,050 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 60% |
| **Justification** | Aligns with consensus broker targets (₹980–1,000), management guidance and current execution. This is the most probable path given current AUM momentum offset by credit-cost headwinds. |

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | AUM growth slows to 15-18% (credit-tightening and slower disbursements), credit cost rises >2.5% (wider MSME/auto / macro shock), NIM compresses 20-40 bps (funding stress), ROE falls below 15%. Multiple contracts to P/B ~4 (risk-off). |
| **Risk Factors** | Rapid deterioration in MSME asset quality, larger-than-expected restructuring, adverse regulatory action, funding shock. |
| **Target Price** | ₹650 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 25% |
| **Justification** | Given leverage and low interest-coverage, a macro or funding shock could materially compress earnings and valuation; non-trivial probability in a downside macro scenario.

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP (Price only) | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return (incl. 0.5% dividend) |
|----------|---------------------------:|-------------:|------------:|--------------------------------------:|
| **Bull Case** | +56.6% | ₹1,400 | 15% | +8.57% |
| **Base Case** | +17.4% | ₹1,050 | 60% | +10.76% |
| **Bear Case** | -27.3% | ₹650 | 25% | -6.70% |
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+12.63%** |

Calculation detail:  
- Bull weighted: 0.15 × (56.64% price gain + 0.5% dividend) ≈ +8.57%  
- Base weighted: 0.60 × (17.44% + 0.5%) ≈ +10.76%  
- Bear weighted: 0.25 × (-27.29% + 0.5%) ≈ -6.70%  
- Sum = +12.63% (12-month probability-weighted expected return)

**Most Likely Scenario:** Base Case — evidence: management guidance (AUM 24-25%), consistent historical execution, broker consensus targets (~₹980-1,000), and current balance-sheet strength point to a moderate-outcome base case being the highest-probability outcome.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | HOLD |
| **Strategy Type** | Hold existing positions; Accumulate selectively on weakness (staggered) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹820 - ₹860 (buy on dips) |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹750 (for new buys; size accordingly) |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,050 (12 months) |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2-5% of portfolio for new allocations) |
| **Timeline** | 12 months (monitor quarterly credit prints) |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Probability-weighted expected return (~+12.6% over 12 months) falls in the HOLD band (≥10% and <15%).  
- Strong franchise, healthy capital and digital/AI roadmap support medium-term growth — but valuations are rich and credit/funding risk elevated.  
- For existing shareholders: hold and review on quarterly asset-quality trends and COF trajectory.  
- For new investors: adopt staggered entry on dips into the ₹820–860 range; keep position size moderate given valuation and credit sensitivity.

## Investment Thesis

1. Bajaj Finance is a top-tier consumer NBFC with strong distribution, digital scale and diversified products — structural growth and high cross-sell provide durable revenue levers.  
2. Management’s FINAI (AI-first) roadmap and large partnerships (e.g., Airtel) can drive operating leverage and customer acquisition — important medium-term upside if executed.  
3. Balance-sheet is well-capitalized (CRAR ~21.9%) with a sizeable liquidity buffer; deposit mobilisation provides a path to lower COF.  
4. Near-term risks stem from elevated credit costs (MSME & selective auto stress) and funding/interest-rate sensitivity (interest coverage ~1.89x). These are the key drivers of near-term earnings volatility.  
5. Valuation is premium; the stock requires continued delivery (credit normalization + FINAI gains) to justify multiple retention — hence a HOLD recommendation with accumulation on dips.
