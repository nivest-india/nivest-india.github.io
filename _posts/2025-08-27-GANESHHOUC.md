### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Ganesh Housing Limited (GANESHHOUC) |
| **Sector** | Real Estate |
| **Current Price** | ₹886 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹7,386 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-27 |

### Industry Overview

- Ahmedabad market is showing structural strength (residential unit sales and large commercial leasing activity) supported by new infrastructure, IFC/GIFT spillovers and improving investor interest.
- Institutional flows into Indian real estate (especially office/SEZ and warehousing) have increased materially over recent years; Ahmedabad has emerged as a regional hub with strong demand for both residential and commercial product.
- Developers with low-cost land banks and strong execution capability are preferred in the current phase because supply discipline and inventory management drive margins.
- Key headwinds remain: rate sensitivity for buyers, local supply pockets, and project execution risks; policy/regulatory changes can create timing uncertainty for monetisation.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ahmedabad residential unit sales growth (company commentary) | ~15% YoY |
| Commercial leasing growth (company commentary) | ~60% YoY (Ahmedabad, reported) |
| Affordability (Ahmedabad) | ~23% (company presentation commentary) |
| Strategic land/pipeline opportunity | ~500+ acres land bank (company filings) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Ahmedabad advantage: Company’s entire pipeline is Ahmedabad‑centric (large land bank ~500+ acres) and benefits from local infra upgrades and GIFT/IFC spillovers — structural tailwind for pricing and absorption.
- Commercial / SEZ demand: Demand for IT/SEZ and commercial space is strong (high institutional leasing) and the company’s Million Minds SEZ targets that demand — provides annuity-like revenue diversification.
- Industry cyclicality & rate sensitivity: Residential demand remains interest‑rate and sentiment sensitive; short-term softness can depress near-term sales though long-term fundamentals are favorable.
- Competitive intensity rising: Pan-India developers moving into Ahmedabad is a near-term risk but company’s local brand + low-cost land gives it advantage.
- Regulatory risk moderate: Local approvals and rezoning are manageable for the company but remain a watch item for timeline risk.

#### Financial Strength: 9/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY25 Revenue | ₹994 Cr (FY25 reported) |
| FY25 EBITDA | ₹813 Cr (FY25 reported) |
| FY25 PAT | ₹598 Cr (FY25 reported) |
| EPS (FY25) | ₹71.72 |
| ROE / ROCE | ROE ~37.8% / ROCE ~44.0% |
| Debt / Equity | 0.14 (low leverage) |
| Cash & cash equivalents | ~₹157 Cr (FY25 balance) |
| Operating cash flows (FY25) | ~₹410 Cr (FY25 cash flow) |
| Working capital days | ~429 days (company metric) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong profitability: FY25 margins (EBITDA ~82% / PAT ~60%) are exceptionally high driven by land monetisation and high-margin commercial/SEZ realization.
- Cash generation and balance sheet: Operating cash flows are robust (FY25), cash balance is healthy and gross borrowings are modest — management highlights a net‑debt‑light / effectively net‑debt‑free stance.
- Low leverage & no pledging: Debt/equity ~0.14 and pledged = 0% reduces financial fragility and gives funding flexibility for capex on SEZ/residential projects.
- Working capital & receivables: High working-capital days and debtor days (Debtor Days ~131) are structural items to monitor — cash conversion is lumpy due to project timing and land-sale recognition.
- Execution funding: Capex on SEZ funded primarily through internal accruals — limits refinancing risk but requires consistent sales conversion.

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current P/E | 12.8x |
| Current Price to Book (P/BV) | 4.02x |
| EV / EBITDA | 9.52x |
| Book Value per share | ~₹220 |
| Market cap | ₹7,386 Cr |
| Independent intrinsic estimate (from data) | ₹1,764 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Attractive P/E: At ~12.8x the stock trades below many listed peers and below historical premium multiples, implying room for multiple expansion if earnings are sustained.
- PBV profile: Price to book ~4.0x — not cheap on PBV versus selected peers (peer median CMP/BV ~3.24) but justified by high ROE and asset margins.
- EV/EBITDA in mid‑single digits relative to high margins suggests valuation leverage; however, comparability with large listed peers is imperfect because earnings mix is lumpy (land sales vs recurring sales).
- Valuation sensitivity: Fair value is highly sensitive to how recurring rental/lease income from SEZ is treated and to the pace of land monetisation; multiple expansion depends on a sustainable run‑rate of high margins.
- Conclusion: Valuation looks reasonable to attractive on P/E basis; watch for sustainability of high margins (lumpy revenue recognition) before assigning a sustained premium.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Land bank (company disclosures) | ~500+ acres developable |
| Pipeline (company guidance) | ~30–36+ msf development potential |
| Management growth guidance | PAT growth guidance 20–30% p.a. |
| Sales growth (5yr CAGR) | ~29% (company historical) |
| EPS growth (3yr) | ~104% (historical) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Large, low-cost land bank: 500+ acres in Ahmedabad gives long runway and optionality for premium residential, commercial and township monetisation.
- Commercial/SEZ upside: Million Minds SEZ and One Thaltej commercial project provide potential for recurring lease income and margin accretion vs pure land sale recognition.
- Proven execution: Track record of delivering projects ahead of schedule (precast usage) helps shorten cash conversion cycles and supports faster monetisation.
- Revenue visibility vs timing risk: While total cash realization of the pipeline is large (multi‑year visibility), timings are subject to sales demand and approvals — revenues can be volatile quarter-to-quarter.
- Guidance credible but execution‑linked: Management’s 20–30% PAT guidance appears achievable given pipeline but execution and leasing timelines are key.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding | 73.06% (stable) |
| FII / DII presence | FII ~0.5–1.0%, DII low |
| Board developments | New directors appointed (Sep 2024) |
| Dividend policy | Dividends paid with variable payout (recent Rs.5/share FY25) |
| Pledged shares | 0.0% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High promoter stake: 73% promoter holding indicates stable control but reduces free float; governance/profile is promoter-led with concentrated ownership.
- Board & disclosures: Fresh independent directors and enhanced disclosures (annual reports, concalls) are positive; management is communicative on strategy and pipeline.
- Shareholder returns: Company pays dividends but retains earnings to fund growth; payout policy appears opportunistic rather than formulaic.
- Related-party and capital structure: Some borrowings include preference capital in the structure — requires monitoring of classifications; no pledging alleviates immediate governance red flags.
- Institutional investor footprint limited: Low FII/DII share means valuation moves can be stock‑specific and liquidity sensitive.

#### Research Reports: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Broker research coverage (past 12 months) | Limited / no large‑broker reports found |
| Company investor presentations | Multiple (Q4 FY25, Q1 FY26, Q3 FY25) |
| Concall transparency | Regular concalls with clear project-level updates |
| Independent intrinsic checks | One independent valuation point ~₹1,764 (data source) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Limited sell‑side coverage: No material broker coverage found in the dataset — reduces breadth of analyst validation and may widen target dispersion.
- Good company disclosures: Company presentations and quarterly concalls are detailed with project timelines, land bank, cash flow and guidance — that offsets weak broker coverage.
- Investor-facing transparency: Management provides project-level metrics and cash flow guidance; concalls show consistent messaging on funding and execution.
- Research gap: Lack of third‑party broker models reduces triangulation — investors should run their own DCF / scenario modelling.
- Action: Monitor for institutional research initiation; use company presentations as primary inputs for modelling.

#### Technical Analysis: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current vs 50 DMA | Trading below 50 DMA (50 DMA ~₹931) |
| Current vs 200 DMA | Trading below 200 DMA (200 DMA ~₹1,004) |
| RSI (14) | ~43.8 (neutral) |
| Momentum / MACD | Momentum neutral; MACD below center (bearish signal) |
| Volume behaviour | Periodic large-volume spikes during news / results |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short-term technicals neutral-to-slightly bearish: Price is below key moving averages (50 & 200 DMA) and MACD is below center — suggests consolidation after a multi-month rally.
- Momentum and RSI neutral: Oscillators show neither oversold nor overbought extremes; risk/reward favors disciplined entries on dips.
- Support/resistance: Pivot area ~₹891; near-term supports around ₹874/₹864; resistance cluster ~₹1,020–1,100 where 50/200 DMAs converge.
- Volume profile: Occasional heavy volumes on news months indicate episodic institutional interest — monitor volume for confirmation of moves.
- Technical view supports a tactical wait-for-dip approach for short-term traders, while medium-term investors focus on fundamentals.

#### Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Recent headlines | Strong FY25 results; Q1 FY26 seasonally muted revenue but margins held |
| Corporate actions | Final dividend declared (Rs.5/share FY25); company name changed (Aug 2025) |
| Investor tone | Positive on pipeline & margins; cautious on short‑term demand |
| News flow | Regular concalls & presentations; limited large-broker commentary |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Positive sentiment on fundamentals: FY25 was a record year on profitability; investors appreciate net-debt-light structure and large pipeline.
- Short‑term caution: Q1 FY26 revenue dip (seasonal/timing) caused near-term profit slowdown vs Q4 FY25 momentum — market priced in a pause.
- Corporate actions supportive: Dividend and rebranding (company name change) are neutral-to-positive signals for shareholders.
- Liquidity and coverage gap: Limited broker coverage may keep stock sensitive to company-specific news; positive corporate updates drive episodic rallies.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoters | 73.06% |
| FIIs | ~0.5% (latest quarter) |
| DIIs | ~0.5% (latest quarter) |
| Public / Retail | ~25.9% |
| Top public shareholders | Family discretionary trusts (~3.76% each), select private investors |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Stable promoter control: Promoter stake steady at ~73% — provides control and alignment but limits public free float.
- Low FII participation: Limited foreign institutional presence reduces immediate institutional appetite; could change as recurring SEZ revenues establish.
- Quality of public holding: Presence of family discretionary trusts and domestic long-term holders suggests some quality public interest but no marquee domestic investors (e.g., high-profile value investors) identified in datasets.
- No pledging: Zero pledged shareholding is credit positive and reduces a governance worry.
- Liquidity consideration: High promoter concentration plus low FII share can cause larger price moves on concentrated flows; investors should consider tranche entries.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E (x) | CMP / BV (x) | ROE (%) | EV / EBITDA |
|------|--------------------|---------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| DLF | 186,787 | 44.1 | 4.39 | 11.4 | 59.35 |
| Lodha Developers | 123,477 | 41.7 | 6.11 | 14.7 | 27.61 |
| Prestige Estates | 69,304 | 131.4 | 4.49 | 3.5 | 26.74 |
| Oberoi Realty | 59,565 | 28.9 | 3.79 | 14.7 | 20.23 |
| Brigade Enterprises | 23,084 | 30.7 | 4.09 | 14.9 | 14.87 |
| Ganesh Housing | 7,386 | 12.8 | 4.02 | 37.8 | 9.52 |

Observations:
- Ganesh Housing trades at materially lower P/E vs many large peers but at comparable PBV. Its ROE and ROCE are substantially higher than most peers — reflecting the company’s high‑margin model (land + selective commercial).
- Peer multiples reflect larger-scale and recurring revenue mixes; Ganesh’s lumpy revenue recognition justifies some valuation discount, but a sustained operational run‑rate could justify multiple expansion.

## Key Strengths
- Large, low-cost land bank (~500+ acres) concentrated in high-demand Ahmedabad corridors.
- Strong FY25 profitability and cash generation with conservative funding of new projects.
- Strategic diversification into SEZ/commercial (Million Minds) offering potential recurring rental/lease income.
- Low leverage and zero pledged shares — strong balance-sheet discipline.
- Proven execution (use of precast) with projects delivered ahead of schedule historically.

## Key Concerns  
- Revenue and PAT are lumpy (land sales / project timing) — creates quarter-to-quarter earnings volatility.
- Geographic concentration in Ahmedabad creates regional risk if local demand softens.
- Working capital (high debtor and WC days) needs active management; delays reduce cash conversion.
- Limited sell‑side coverage and low FII participation — can limit liquidity and external validation.
- Execution and leasing timing on large commercial / SEZ projects is critical; any delay compresses valuation.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,760 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** - Successful on-time leasing and fit-outs at Million Minds SEZ; early rental / annuity income recognition. - Strong pricing momentum in Ahmedabad leading to higher realisations on township / One Thaltej sales. - Multiple expansion to premium (P/E ~25–26) on credible recurring annuity + sustained high ROE; market rewards proven execution. - Continued conservative financing and limited new leverage.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,140 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** - Management delivers modest PAT growth (20–30% guided) and SEZ Phase I achieves expected lease conversions; earnings mix shifts from land-sale to recurring/commercial contributions. - Multiple expansion from 12.8x to ~16.5x (median PE) on improved visibility of sustained margins and steady cash flows. - No major execution delays; revenues remain lumpy but FY26 is materially better than FY25 on project monetisation.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹600 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** - Demand softness and/or higher rates lead to slower bookings and delayed monetisation of major projects (Godhavi / One Thaltej). - Execution or leasing delays at SEZ push rental start beyond guidance and pressure margins. - Multiple compression due to market risk aversion and limited institutional interest.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹1,760 | +~99% | Best‑case: strong execution + multiple expansion |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹1,140 | +~29% | Most likely: steady execution, gradual multiple re‑rating |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹600 | -~32% | Execution/demand setbacks and multiple compression |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (based on Realistic scenario: +29% upside vs CMP)  
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Balance of strong net‑asset base, high ROE/ROCE and pipeline versus execution/timing risk. Upside skewed if SEZ leasing and township monetisation progress on plan; downside limited by healthy balance sheet but non-trivial because of revenue lumpiness.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price (realistic) | Position Size | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------|---------------|----------|
| BUY | Core growth allocation | ₹820 — ₹930 | 15% below purchase price (tactical) | ₹1,140 (12 months) | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Valuation gap vs median P/E and strong ROE suggest scope for multiple re‑rating if earnings convert from land sales to recurring commercial/lease income.
- Balance sheet strength, low leverage and high cash generation reduce financing risk for the large pipeline.
- Catalysts (SEZ leasing, One Thaltej approvals & Godhavi monetisation) are visible and could trigger re-rating.
- Key risks (timing, working capital) can create volatility — use tranches and defined stop loss.

## Investment Thesis
1. Asset-backed growth with a sizeable low-cost land bank (~500+ acres) provides long-term revenue visibility and optionality in product mix (residential, commercial, township, SEZ).  
2. FY25 demonstrated the margin and cash-flow potential (EBITDA margin ~82%, PAT margin ~60%) — conservative funding of SEZ shows capital discipline.  
3. Transition toward commercial/SEZ (annuity-like revenue) can materially de-risk earnings cyclicality and justify higher multiples.  
4. Valuation today (P/E ~12.8x) leaves room for multiple expansion as recurring revenues and lease ramps validate FY guidance.  
5. Execution and demand risks remain the primary downside; monitor quarterly cash conversion, leasing confirmations and presale velocity on residential launches.
