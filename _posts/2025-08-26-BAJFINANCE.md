### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Bajaj Finance Ltd. (BAJFINANCE) |
| **Sector** | NBFC - Consumer & Lending |
| **Current Price** | ₹876 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹5,44,708 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-26 |

### Industry Overview

- India consumer & SME credit continues to expand but with uneven sectoral momentum — secured segments (mortgages, gold) showing resilience while some unsecured SME and certain vehicle segments face stress.
- NBFCs continue to grow faster than bank credit in retail niches; differentiated distribution, data/AI underwriting and retail deposits are competitive advantages.
- Funding mix and cost-of-funds remain critical for NBFC margins; access to wholesale markets, NCDs and ECBs plus deposit mobilisation determine NIM volatility.
- Regulatory and macro cycles matter: provisioning models and early‑vintage delinquencies can spike quickly in stressed segments (MSME, auto), so portfolio composition and early-warning indicators are central.
- Bajaj Finance sits at the intersection of scale + digital distribution + diverse product mix, making sector tailwinds and idiosyncratic credit risks the primary drivers of its performance.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM (FY25) | ₹4,16,661 Cr |
| Customer Franchise (FY25) | 101.8 Mn customers |
| Market share (by credit) | ~2.1% (company disclosure) |
| AUM Growth (FY25 YoY) | +25-26% |
| Key growth drivers | Mortgages, Urban B2C, Gold loans, Digital distribution |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Scale & diversification: Bajaj Finance has broad product coverage (mortgage, consumer, SME, gold, payments) which mitigates single‑segment cyclicality and merits a high sector score.
- Large customer franchise & digital reach: >100 Mn customers and a large distribution network provide structural advantage in customer acquisition and cross‑sell.
- Secular sector tailwinds: consumer credit penetration and digital distribution continue to grow — beneficial for a market leader.
- Funding sensitivity: NBFCs are sensitive to wholesale markets and deposit mobilisation; this is a sector constraint but Bajaj’s diversified funding partly offsets it.
- Competitive intensity & regulatory risk: rising competition in mortgages and fintech disruption are sector challenges; regulatory changes on risk‑weights or provisioning could quickly re-rate NBFCs.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net Profit (FY25) | ₹16,779 Cr (FY25) |
| AUM (FY25) | ₹4,16,661 Cr |
| Borrowings (Mar 2025) | ₹3,61,249 Cr |
| Capital Adequacy (CRAR FY25) | 21.9% |
| Liquidity buffer (Jun 2025) | ~₹14,922 - ₹18,754 Cr (disclosed ranges) |
| ROE / ROA (FY25) | ROE 19.2% / ROA ~4.6% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong profitability & returns: High ROE (~19%) and sizeable PAT support credit strength and capital generation.
- Healthy capital & liquidity: CRAR >21% and a material liquidity buffer provide coverage for unexpected shocks and growth capital.
- Leverage & funding: Borrowings are large (₹3.6 Lakh Cr) and operating cashflows are negative (by design due to lending growth) — necessitates active funding management; manageable but a risk if markets tighten.
- Asset quality: GNPA/NNPA remain low by industry standards (GNPA ~1.0% / NNPA ~0.44% FY25) but have shown signs of pressure in selected segments (MSME, 2W/3W) — monitored closely.
- Cash-flow dynamics: Negative operating cash flows reflect aggressive loan disbursements and AUM growth — sustainable only with stable access to markets / deposits; management has been building liquidity buffers and raising long-term funding.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | ₹876 |
| P/E (TTM) | ~31.3x |
| Price / Book | ~5.6x |
| EV / EBITDA | ~17.8x |
| Median peer P/E | ~20.9x (peer median from comparison set) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Premium valuation: Bajaj Finance trades at a significant premium to median NBFC peers on P/E and P/B, reflecting leadership, growth and execution track record.
- Justified by scale & ROE: High ROE and superior execution partially justify a premium multiple, but not indefinitely if credit cost normalises higher or growth disappoints.
- Relative downside if credit cost rises: Valuation is sensitive to credit-cost surprises — a reversion in multiple could be swift.
- Room for re‑rating: If management executes FinAI cost savings and credit normalises, multiple could expand further; conversely, persistent MSME/auto stress could compress valuations.
- Peer context: Compared with peers (Cholamandalam, SBI Cards, Shriram), Bajaj is priced at a premium — the premium requires continued outperformance.

#### Growth Potential: 9/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM Growth FY25 | +25% YoY |
| FY26 AUM guidance | 24-25% (management guidance) |
| New loans booked (FY25) | 43.42 Mn |
| Customer franchise growth FY25 | 83.6 → 101.8 Mn |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High organic growth: Strong AUM growth and record new-loan bookings demonstrate a powerful distribution engine and product acceptance.
- Product & channel expansion: Scale-up in gold, mortgages (BHFL), and digital partnerships (Airtel) provide diversified growth levers.
- FinAI (AI-first) transformation: Potential for step-change in operating leverage and underwriting precision — a material growth enabler if execution matches intent.
- Cross-sell potential: Large customer base allows meaningful fee and product penetration upside—key for sustainable EPS growth.
- Execution risks but high optionality: Growth is ambitious but deliverable given the platform; downside risk is concentrated credit stress in specific verticals which management is actively pruning.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter Holding | ~54.7% |
| Recent leadership moves | MD resignation (Anup Saha) and appointment of Rajeev Jain (VC & MD till Mar 2028) |
| ESOP / allotments | Periodic ESOP allotments reported |
| Dividend policy | Dividend payout ~20% in FY25; large special dividend & bonus in 2025 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Majority promoter ownership (~54.7%) gives stability but concentrate control; Bajaj Finserv remains a strong promoter with aligned interests.
- Management quality: Historically strong execution — though recent MD resignation (Jul 2025) is a governance event; board has appointed a seasoned internal leader (Rajeev Jain) for continuity.
- Capital returns: High special dividends, bonus and split in 2025 indicate shareholder-friendly posture; however, they also reduce retained capital for re-investment (though the company remains well-capitalised).
- Transparency & disclosures: Regular concalls, investor presentations and research coverage; however, large ESOP issuance and preferential allotments require monitoring for O/S share dynamics.
- Succession & stewardship: Interim succession seems handled internally but investors should watch for longer-term CEO succession clarity.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Broker | Date | Call | Target Price |
|--------|------|------|--------------|
| Prabhudas Lilladher | 25 Jul 2025 | HOLD | ₹900 |
| Sharekhan / Mirae Asset | 03 May & 28 Jul 2025 | BUY | ₹980 / ₹1,000 |
| Motilal Oswal | 24 May 2025 | NEUTRAL | ₹1,000 |
| Other coverage (consensus) | 2025 | Mixed | Range ₹900–1,000 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Wide analyst coverage: Strong institutional interest and multiple broker reports provide diversified viewpoints and a consensus framework.
- Mixed near-term views: Broker TPs cluster around ₹900–1,000 reflecting concerns on credit cost despite strong AUM growth; some brokers are constructive (Buy) while others are neutral/hold.
- Valuation vs fundamentals: Brokers diverge on whether current valuations already price in recovery and FinAI benefits — this creates both confirmation and contrarian opportunities.
- Useful scenario inputs: Brokers provide pragmatic scenarios (credit-cost assumptions, NIM paths) that help triangulate realistic targets.
- Research limitations: Most broker valuations use ABV/PB multiples rather than DCF; given BAJFIN’s balance-sheet leverage and product mix, multiple-based valuation is common but sensitive to provisioning assumptions.

#### Technical Analysis: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last price (26 Aug 2025) | ₹876.25 |
| 50 DMA | ₹901.10 |
| 200 DMA | ₹852.43 |
| RSI (14) | 43.8 |
| Momentum Score (Trendlyne) | 52.7 (Technically Neutral) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price positioning: Trading below 50-DMA but above 200-DMA suggests short-term consolidation with medium-term uptrend intact.
- Oscillators neutral-to-slightly-bearish: RSI in mid-range and MACD below center indicate limited upside momentum in the very short term.
- Volume & liquidity: Post-split/bonus liquidity improved materially — higher turnover supports both institutional flows and price discovery.
- Support/resistance: Near-term pivot ~₹883–884 (resistance) and support band ~₹856–865; a break below support would signal technical weakness.
- Conclusion: Technicals do not contradict a medium-term accumulation thesis but advise buying on dips with confirmation (price above 50-DMA) for shorter-term traders.

#### Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Indicator | Recent Signal |
|-----------|---------------|
| Q1 FY26 results | Strong AUM/profit growth but elevated credit costs; mixed market reaction |
| Corporate actions | Stock split + 4:1 bonus (Jun 2025) improved liquidity |
| Management change | MD resignation (Jul 2025) — short-term sentiment negative, continuity via internal appointment |
| Credit ratings | Multiple rating actions/upgrades noted (CRISIL, S&P interactions) — supportive |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Positive: recent quarters & FY25 showed strong growth and shareholder returns (dividend/bonus) — supportive sentiment.
- Negative: elevated credit costs and MSME/auto stress introduced caution; MD resignation created near-term sentiment volatility.
- Market microstructure: split & bonus increased retail participation and turnover — improves base of buyers/sellers.
- News flow: Analyst notes, concall transparency and active investor meetings moderate panic risk but sentiment is cautious until credit-cost trajectory is clearer.
- Net: sentiment is constructive for medium-term investors but volatile for short-term traders.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 8/10

| Holder | Jun 2025 |
|--------|----------|
| Promoters | 54.73% |
| FIIs | 21.71% |
| DIIs | 14.52% |
| Public / Others | 8.92% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Stable promoter block: >50% promoter holding gives strategic consistency and long-term commitment.
- Strong institutional ownership: FIIs (~21.7%) and DIIs (~14.5%) indicate confidence from large investors and provide price support/discipline.
- No material pledging: No promoter pledging reported — reduces forced-sale risk.
- No marquee retail/celebrity investor concentration observed in top public holdings (based on latest public filings) — ownership is largely institutional and promoter.
- Trend: FIIs have been adding modestly in recent periods, which is a positive signal for capital inflows and liquidity.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (₹Cr) | P/E | P/BV | ROE% | EV/EBITDA |
|------|------------------:|----:|-----:|-----:|----------:|
| Bajaj Finance | 5,44,708 | 31.3 | 5.6 | 19.2 | 17.8 |
| Cholamandalam Inv & Fn | 1,24,216 | 27.9 | 5.2 | 19.7 | 14.9 |
| SBI Cards | 77,621 | 41.3 | 5.6 | 14.8 | 20.4 |
| Shriram Finance | 1,11,822 | 13.1 | 1.98 | 15.6 | 10.3 |
| Median (peer set) | — | ~21 | ~1.9–4.4 | ~9–12 | ~12 |

- Bajaj Finance commands a premium vs most peers on valuation metrics, supported by higher ROE, stronger AUM growth and scale; the premium reflects market confidence but raises downside risk if operational/credit trends worsen.

## Key Strengths
- Market leader with a large customer franchise (>100 Mn) and multiple distribution channels (digital + 4,000+ locations).
- Strong track record of AUM and earnings growth (FY25 AUM +25% and robust PAT growth).
- High ROE and comfortable capital adequacy (CRAR >21%) provide room to absorb shocks.
- FinAI (AI-first) transformation and strategic partnerships (e.g., Airtel) offer meaningful operating‑leverage potential.
- Shareholder-friendly capital actions (bonus, split, dividends) improve liquidity and retail access.

## Key Concerns  
- Elevated credit costs (MSME and legacy 2W/3W exposure) — provisioning and early-vintage delinquencies need monitoring.
- Valuation premium; limited margin for error — earnings misses can trigger multiple compression.
- Funding and cash‑flow sensitivity: heavy lending growth requires disciplined access to wholesale markets and deposit mobilisation.
- Management transition risk: recent MD resignation (Jul 2025) introduces short-term execution uncertainty.
- Concentration risks in specific segments/geographies (example: higher exposure in certain southern states flagged by management).

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,400 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Rapid normalisation of credit costs to sub‑1.8% (FY26), FinAI delivers >₹150 Cr p.a. efficiency within 12 months, AUM growth sustains 24–26%, and market re-rates to a premium PB/PE (reflecting sustained ROE 20%+). Multiple expansion to ~PB 8x (or P/E ~40) as the market rewards durable improvement in asset quality and margin expansion.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,060 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management meets FY26 guidance (AUM +24–25%, credit cost ~1.85–1.95%), modest NIM improvement (10 bps) as cost-of-funds declines, FinAI begins to show measurable OPEX leverage, book value rises ~12–15% and market maintains a moderate premium (P/B ~6.0) — combined implies ~20–25% total return.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹760 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** MSME/auto stress worsens (credit cost rises >2.5%), GNPA expands to 1.2–1.6% and PCR weakens; market de-rates valuation to P/B ~4x or P/E ~18x amid rising provisions and slower AUM growth (sub‑15%) — price falls into the ₹700–800 band.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|--------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹1,400 | +60% | Re‑rating + strong credit normalisation; high upside if execution & AI savings materialise |
| Realistic | ₹1,060 | +21% | Base case: guidance met, credit cost contained, modest multiple expansion — implies BUY (≥15% upside) |
| Pessimistic | ₹760 | -13% | Credit deterioration & multiple compression — illustrates downside risk and need for stop-loss discipline |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (based on realistic scenario showing ~+21% upside vs current price)  
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Upside (realistic) ~+21% vs downside (pessimistic) ~‑13% — asymmetric but dependent on credit cost trajectory. Recommend a measured allocation with active monitoring of early‑vintage delinquency and quarterly credit-cost trends.

## Investment Recommendation

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Call** | BUY |
| **Conviction** | Medium-High (fundamental quality offset by credit-risk vigilance) |
| **Strategy Type** | Core accumulation (12-month horizon) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹820 - ₹900 |
| **Primary Target** | ₹1,060 (12 months) |
| **Alternate Target (AGGRESSIVE)** | ₹1,400 (18 months) |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹740 (protect capital if adverse credit signals intensify) |
| **Position Size Guidance** | Medium (2-5% of portfolio) — increase to Large (5-10%) only if credit-cost trend shows sustained improvement and management confirms roadmap execution |
| **Rebalance / Review** | Review after each quarterly results and after any significant management or rating announcements |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Business quality (scale, digital reach, product diversification) and capital adequacy support medium-term earnings growth.
- Realistic upside >15% (BUY threshold) driven by guidance-consistent AUM growth and modest multiple expansion; downside is controlled but non-trivial if credit stress deepens.
- Use staged buying on weakness and maintain stop-loss discipline to manage credit and valuation risks.

## Investment Thesis

1. Market-leading NBFC with large franchise (100+ Mn customers), diversified products (mortgage, gold, consumer, SME) and superior distribution — structural advantages that support above-industry growth.
2. High returns and capital buffer: ROE ~19%, CRAR >21% — company can grow while maintaining cushion against provisioning shocks.
3. FinAI transformation + digital partnerships (Airtel etc.) provide tangible optionality for operating-cost reductions and faster, better underwriting — a multi-quarter to multi-year re-rating catalyst if realized.
4. Primary near-term risk is credit-cost trajectory (MSME & legacy 2W/3W exposure). Management’s proactive pruning and restructuring reduce tail risk but require monitoring of vintage performance and provisioning.
5. Valuation is rich yet justifiable if credit costs normalize and FinAI benefits accrue; the realistic-case target implies BUY for investors comfortable with active monitoring of quarterly credit metrics.
