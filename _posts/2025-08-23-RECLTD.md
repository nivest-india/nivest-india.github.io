### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | REC Limited (RECLTD) |
| **Sector** | Financial Services - NBFC (Power & Infrastructure Finance) |
| **Current Price** | ₹376 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹98,904 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-23 |

### Industry Overview

- India power & infrastructure financing is in a multi‑year growth phase driven by distribution reforms (RDSS), large renewable build‑outs, smart meter rollouts and accelerated disbursements for transmission & generation projects.  
- Policy tailwinds (central schemes such as RDSS, PM Surya Ghar, Saubhagya) and sovereign support create visibility for lending volumes and low‑cost funding access for NBFCs like REC.  
- Headwinds include state fiscal stress, PPA signing delays for some renewable projects and increasing competition from banks/NBFCs on refinance/prepayment flows.  
- Market opportunity: large pipeline for power & renewables financing (order of magnitude: ₹12,00,000 Cr pipeline across power & renewables over coming years — indicative industry pipeline).  
- Technology and digitalization (smart meters, grid modernization) add execution/monitoring benefits and create new financing products (meter funding, energy‑efficiency loans).

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | 10–12% (3‑5 yr outlook) |
| Market Size | ₹12,00,000 Cr (indicative power + renewables pipeline) |
| Sector Tailwinds | Strong government programmes, green transition, large capex, favorable funding via green/54EC bonds |
| Sector Headwinds | DISCOM fiscal health, PPA/tariff delays, competition on refinancing |
| Policy Support | Strong (nodal agency status for multiple schemes; Maharatna) |
| Competition Level | Medium (banks & NBFCs increasingly active) |
| Technology Disruption | Positive (smart meters, digital underwriting) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- REC operates in a policy‑led segment with durable tailwinds (RDSS, rooftop/rooftop solar, renewables) — supports a high score.  
- Government backing and nodal agency roles reduce demand uncertainty and provide funding advantages (cheap 54EC/green bonds).  
- Sector risks (state finances, PPA delays) are material but manageable given REC’s focus and provisioning.  
- Near‑term opportunity set (distribution capex + renewables) is large and sticky — 10–12% industry growth is reasonable.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Debt-to-Equity | 6.33 | Peer median ~6.14 (typical for NBFCs) |
| Interest Coverage | 1.61x | Peer range ~1.3–1.7x (NBFC sector) |
| Free Cash Flow (TTM) | -₹39,147 Cr | Negative (lending business; disbursements drive cash use) |
| Current Ratio | 1.13 | >1.2 (general benchmark) |
| Quick Ratio | 1.13 | >1.0 (general benchmark) |
| Net Debt | ~₹4,93,900 Cr (Borrowings ₹4,96,243 Cr less Cash ₹2,343 Cr) | Lower better |
| Cash & Equivalents | ₹2,343 Cr | Higher is better |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Leverage (Debt/Equity ~6.3x) is high in absolute terms but broadly in line with comparable power/infrastructure NBFC peers (PEER: PFC, IRFC). REC’s AAA domestic ratings and diversified funding mix (domestic bonds, ECBs, 54EC) mitigate rollover/refinancing risk.  
- Interest coverage is low in absolute terms (1.61x) but consistent with peers; the core metric for NBFCs is NIM and provisioning adequacy rather than EBITDA coverage. REC’s NIM (~3.7%) and strong capital ratios (CAR ~24–26%) support debt servicing.  
- Operating cash flows are negative at times because lending requires upfront outflows; this is offset by predictable funding and strong bond access. Monitor FCF as loan book growth normalizes.  
- Balance‑sheet quality: strong capital buffers (CRAR > 23–25%), healthy provision coverage for stressed assets (>70%+), and minimal promoter pledge — supports a strong score.

#### Valuations: 8/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg | Historical Avg |
|-------------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| P/E Ratio | 5.9x | Peer med ~24x | Historically low |
| P/B Ratio | 1.26x | Peer med ~2.35x | Below historical premium |
| EV/EBITDA | 10.5x | Peer ~13.5x | In-line/discount |
| Market Cap / Sales | 1.70x | — | — |
| PEG (approx) | ~0.4 | — | — |
| EV/Sales | — | — | — |

**Score Reasoning:**
- REC trades at a marked discount to peers on P/E and P/B despite high ROE (~21.5%) — valuation looks attractive relative to fundamentals.  
- ROE (21.5%) supports a premium multiple vs general NBFC universe but current pricing reflects conservative multiples (P/B ~1.2–1.3).  
- EV/EBITDA ~10.5x is reasonable for a well‑capitalised NBFC with high ROE and improving asset quality.  
- Key valuation risk: market re‑rating depends on sustained NIM, resolution of stressed assets and re‑rating of the NBFC sector.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 21.5% |
| ROCE | 9.96% |
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | ~13% |
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | ~13.5% |
| CAPEX (FY25 corporate) | ~₹83 Cr (fixed assets purchases) |
| CAPEX/Revenue | Negligible (lending business) |
| Dividend Payout | ~30% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High ROE and management guidance (loan book growth ~12% for FY26, medium‑term AUM target to ₹10 lakh Cr by FY30) point to steady, high‑quality earnings growth.  
- Primary growth drivers: distribution capex (RDSS/RBPF), renewable energy financing, selective infra & logistics foray.  
- Constraints: elevated prepayments/refinancing (increases churn), competition in renewables/refinance, and state‑level execution/timing.  
- Capital adequacy and strong margins allow room to grow the book without dilution — favourable growth profile.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | Regular (quarterly) |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Clear (government schemes, renewables, infra foray) |
| Management Communication | High (frequent guidance & transparency) |
| Governance Score | 8/10 |
| Transparency Rating | High |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | ~4.8% |
| Dividend History | Consistent and shareholder friendly (high payout) |
| Recent Buyback | None |
| Capital Allocation Efficiency | Strong ROE; prudent provisioning |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management communicates clearly (detailed quarterly presentations & concalls), provides explicit guidance on loan book growth, margins and provisioning. New CMD (appointed Apr 2025) has relevant experience; continuity appears intact.  
- Governance markers: Maharatna status, AAA domestic ratings, ISO 31000 risk management certification, zero promoter pledge and regular high dividends.  
- Areas to monitor: the very high payout ratio reduces retained earnings for rapid internal capital build but is consistent with PSU policy and shareholder expectations.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Average Target Price (covered reports) | ₹535 (12 months) |
| Current Price | ₹376 |
| Upside/Downside | ~+42% (average broker TP vs CMP) |
| Buy Recommendations | Majority (multiple brokers: BUY) |
| Hold / Sell | Few / None |
| Consensus Rating | BUY |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Broker coverage is constructive — most recent large broker notes (Motilal Oswal, ICICI Securities, Emkay) rate REC as BUY with 12‑month targets in the ₹460–₹600 range.  
- Brokers cite improving asset quality, provision reversals, superior ROE, strong dividend yield and a large disbursement pipeline as key positives.  
- Consensus bias to BUY supports investor confidence; downside risk remains execution of stressed asset resolutions.

#### Technical Analysis & Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Period | Return | vs Nifty |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 Month | -4.5% | Underperformed |
| 3 Month | -6.5% | Underperformed |
| 6 Month | -2.0% | Mixed |
| 1 Year | -36% | Underperformed |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| RSI | N/A |
| 50-DMA | ₹393.67 |
| 200-DMA | ₹427.61 |
| Volume Trend | Moderate; lower than peak months |

| Market Sentiment & Near-term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| News Sentiment | Positive (record disbursements, dividends) |
| Social Media Buzz | Moderate |
| Options Activity | Neutral |
| Upcoming Events | Quarterly results, Govt schemes updates, policy changes |
| Short-term Catalysts | Provision reversals, disbursement momentum, dividends |
| Near-term Risks | Rate environment, prepayment/refinance flows |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is below 50‑DMA and 200‑DMA — near‑term technical bias neutral/bearish.  
- Sentiment is supported by strong fundamentals (record disbursements, dividend announcements) but market has re‑priced from 2024 highs; volatility possible with macro or policy shifts.  
- Low RSI data availability prevents detailed momentum read but volume patterns show episodic buying at lower levels.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 9/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % | Previous % | Change |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Promoter Holding | 52.63% | 52.63% | 0.00% |
| FII Holding | 19.16% (Jun 2025) | ~21.7% (Dec 24) | -2.5% |
| DII Holding | 15.51% (Jun 2025) | ~14.8% (Mar 25) | +0.7% |
| Public Holding | 12.65% | ~12% | +0.6% |
| Pledged Shares | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | FIIs present (Government of Singapore, global funds), MF participation | 
| Recent Changes | Stable promoter holding; gradual FII rotation |
| News Sentiment | Positive (institutional interest in green bonds and dividend) |
| Options Activity | Neutral |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Promoter (Power Finance Corporation) holding stable at 52.63% — provides strategic stability and sovereign linkage.  
- Institutional ownership (FIIs + DIIs) meaningful and includes quality investors; no promoter pledge.  
- Shareholding composition supports long‑term stability and reduces risk of hostile moves.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | Discount | REC trades at P/E ~5.9x and P/B ~1.26x vs peer med P/E ~24x and P/B ~2.35x; discount reflects cautious pricing despite higher ROE. |
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Superior profitability | REC RoE ~21.5% and NIM ~3.6% are above many infrastructure financiers; asset quality and CAR are competitive. |

## Key Strengths
- Strong government/sovereign linkage and nodal agency status for flagship programmes (RDSS, Surya Ghar, Saubhagya).  
- High ROE (~21.5%), improving NIM (~3.7%) and record FY25 profitability (PAT ₹15,713 Cr).  
- Diversified, low‑cost funding mix (domestic bonds, 54EC, ECBs); AAA domestic ratings.  
- Large, visible sanction & disbursement pipeline (record disbursements Q1 FY26 ₹59,508 Cr; loan book ~₹5.85 lakh Cr).  
- Shareholder friendly (consistent high dividends, zero promoter pledge).

## Key Concerns  
- High leverage (typical for NBFCs) — interest coverage low in absolute terms; dependent on stable NIM and funding spreads.  
- Exposure concentration to state sector (~87% of loan book) — reliant on state fiscal health and tariff reforms.  
- Prepayment/refinancing flows could mute net AUM growth despite high disbursements.  
- Execution/timing risk on large renewable and infra projects (PPA signing delays).  
- Market re‑rating depends on resolution of remaining stressed assets and consistency of margins.

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Loan book growth +15% (12 months), NIM improves to 3.9% (higher renewables mix), credit cost negligible (provision reversals ₹7–9k Cr), BV/share expands to ₹360, market re‑rating to P/B 1.8–2.0. |
| **Catalysts** | Faster resolution of stressed assets (provision reversals), larger‑than‑expected renewables disbursements, continuing low cost of funds via green bonds, policy support extension for RDSS. |
| **Target Price** | ₹650 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Justification** | Upside driven by a combination of earnings beat (higher NII) and multiple expansion as market rewards sustained ROE and zero/low NPA trajectory. REC’s AAA funding, green bond access and management track record make this achievable but execution‑sensitive. |

### Base Case Scenario (Most Likely)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Loan book growth ~12% (next 12 months, management guidance), NIM stable ~3.7% (Q1 FY26 = 3.74%), modest provision reversals (~₹2–4k Cr), BV/share rises to ~₹335, market values at P/B ~1.6. |
| **Execution Milestones** | Continued strong disbursements (distribution + renewables), net zero NPA target met or near met, steady funding costs. |
| **Target Price** | ₹540 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 60% |
| **Justification** | Aligns with management guidance, prevailing broker consensus, and observed Q1 FY26 performance (record disbursements, strong PAT). This is the recommended base target and underpins the primary recommendation. |

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Loan book growth slows to 6–8% (prepayment/refinance accelerates), NIM compresses to ~3.4% due to spread pressure, delayed/protracted recoveries on stressed accounts forcing incremental provisioning, BV/share stalls ~₹298, multiple reverts to P/B ~1.0. |
| **Risk Factors** | Material delay in stressed asset resolution, sharp increase in funding costs, deterioration in DISCOM fiscal health, or adverse regulatory changes. |
| **Target Price** | ₹320 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Justification** | Market de‑rates when recoveries fail to materialize and margins compress; downside limited by high provisioning and sovereign‑linked portfolio, but possible if multiple adverse events coincide.

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bull Case** | +72.9% | ₹650 | 20% | +14.6% |
| **Base Case** | +43.6% | ₹540 | 60% | +26.2% |
| **Bear Case** | -14.9% | ₹320 | 20% | -3.0% |
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+37.8%** |

Probability‑weighted expected return = 0.20×72.9% + 0.60×43.6% + 0.20×(-14.9%) = **+37.8% (12 months)**

Most Likely Scenario: Base Case (60%) — Evidence: management guidance (12% loan book growth), Q1 FY26 execution (record disbursements ₹59,508 Cr, loan book ₹5.845 lakh Cr), improving asset quality (gross NPA / net NPA down, high PCR), and broad broker consensus around ₹500–600 TP range.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | STRONG BUY |
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered buy (accumulate on dips) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹360 - ₹420 |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹320 (for tactical positions) |
| **Target Price** | ₹540 (12 months) |
| **Position Size** | Medium / Large (core allocation up to 5% of portfolio depending on risk appetite) |
| **Timeline** | 12 months (primary); re‑rate / re‑evaluate at 18 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Strong probability‑weighted expected return (~+37.8% over 12 months) implies STRONG BUY per the mandated rating thresholds (≥20%).  
- Power/infrastructure financing remains structurally advantaged with REC as a government‑linked specialist lender enjoying preferential funding and policy access.  
- Improving asset quality, high provision coverage and record disbursements indicate earnings momentum and reduced tail risk.  
- Attractive current valuation (P/E ~5.9x; P/B ~1.26x) provides margin of safety; dividend yield (~4.8%) adds income while upside materializes.  
- Key risks (prepayments, funding spread widening, delayed recoveries) are real — advised approach: staggered buys and tight tactical stop loss for short/medium term positions.

## Investment Thesis
- REC is the quasi‑sovereign, sectoral financier for India’s power transition — large, visible sanctioned pipeline and nodal agency roles underwrite loan growth.  
- Strong capital position (CAR >23–25%), AAA domestic ratings and diversified funding (green bonds, 54EC, ECBs) limit refinancing risk and preserve spreads.  
- High profitability metrics (RoE ~21.5%, improving NIM) justify a re‑rating as asset quality normalises — valuation currently discounts that outcome.  
- Management execution has been credible: record disbursements, progressive resolution of stressed assets and consistent dividend policy.  
- Risk‑reward: limited downside (valuation near book) but large upside from multiple expansion and provision reversals — favorable for long‑term accumulation.
