### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Equitas Small Finance Bank Ltd (EQUITASBNK) |
| **Sector** | Small Finance Bank / Financial Services |
| **Current Price** | ₹50.27 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹5,733 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- Small‑Finance Banks (SFBs) are shifting from high‑yield unsecured microfinance to secured retail (SBL, housing, used vehicles) to improve asset quality and reduce volatility.  
- Regulatory guardrails (MFI rules, state ordinances) and tighter RBI provisioning norms have increased near‑term credit costs for MFI-heavy lenders.  
- Deposit mobilisation (CASA growth, NR/FCNR inflows) and cost‑of‑funds compression remain the primary levers for margin recovery in the sector.  
- Competition from NBFCs and digital lenders is intense in vehicle finance and SBL; scale and liability mix (CASA) distinguish winners.  
- Macro and rate cycles heavily influence NIMs: SFBs with stronger retail deposit franchises tend to outperform on margin sustainability.

## Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Industry | Small Finance Banks (SFB) |
| Median peer P/BV (peer set) | 0.95 |
| Median peer ROE | 10.38% |
| Sector dynamics | MFI guardrails, secured‑loan reallocation |
| Typical NIM band (SFBs) | ~6.5%–8.0% (sector range) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- SFB sector structurally attractive: large underserved customer base and room for secured‑loan expansion (positive long‑term demand).  
- Regulatory headwinds to MFI (guardrails, state ordinances) cause short‑term volatility but accelerate healthier secured lending (net positive structurally).  
- Margin sensitivity to cost‑of‑funds is high; banks with liability franchises will outperform (key sector risk).  
- Competitive intensity in secured retail and used‑vehicle financing is rising; winners need strong underwriting and digital distribution.  
- Overall sector opportunity is good but execution and funding mix are critical — hence 7/10.

#### Financial Strength: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total assets (Mar 2025) | ₹52,836 Cr |
| Gross advances (Mar 2025 / Q1 FY26) | ~₹37,986 Cr / ₹37,610 Cr (Q1 FY26) |
| Deposits (Q1 FY26) | ₹44,379 Cr |
| CASA (Q1 FY26) | 29% |
| CRAR (Jun 2025) | 20.48% |
| GNPA / NNPA (Q1 FY26) | 2.82% / 0.95% |
| Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR, Q1 FY26) | 67.03% |
| NIM (Q1 FY26) | 6.55% |
| Net result (Q1 FY26) | Net loss ₹224 Cr (one‑off provisioning impact) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Capital & liquidity: CRAR ~20.5% and strong LCR provide good headroom for growth and shock absorption.  
- Deposit franchise: deposits grew strongly (YoY) and CASA ~29% is a positive base to lower funding cost over time.  
- Asset quality: GNPA ~2.8% with PCR ~67% — better than many stressed peers on PCR, but rising provisioning and concentrated stress in MFI/MSE buckets are near‑term concerns.  
- Profitability & cash flow: Q1 FY26 reported a large loss due to upfront provisions; core operating profitability (PPOP) remains positive, but near‑term earnings are weak and TTM PAT is negative.  
- Funding & NIM pressures: cost of funds elevated; NIM compressed from earlier levels — balance sheet structure strong but earnings stability is recovering — hence a middle rating.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price to Book (current) | 0.94x |
| Book Value per share | ~₹53.3 |
| P/E | Not meaningful (TTM negative EPS) |
| EV/EBITDA | ~14.9 |
| Peer median P/BV | 0.95 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Relative cheapness on P/B: trading below book (0.94x) and broadly in line or slightly cheaper than peer median — supports value case if earnings normalize.  
- P/E is not usable while TTM EPS is negative; earnings recovery is required for P/E‑based valuation.  
- Broker valuations (range: ~₹55–₹80) show divergent views — market reflecting execution risk vs. structural upside.  
- Upside depends on normalization of credit cost and modest P/B expansion; downside risk remains if MFI stress persists.  
- Valuation looks reasonable for selective, risk‑aware investors but requires improved fundamentals to re-rate.

#### Growth Potential: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Management FY26 advance growth guidance | 15–16% (Q1 FY26) |
| Secured book share (Q1 FY26) | ~90% of advances classified as secured (management commentary) |
| MFI share (Q1 FY26) | ~9% (declining) |
| Digital sourcing (Selfe app) | ~₹437 Cr originated (early traction) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Clear strategic shift away from unsecured MFI to secured SBL, used vehicles, housing — improves risk‑adjusted returns over time.  
- Management targets mid‑teens advance growth; secured book expected to grow >20% — credible and visible given branch + digital reach.  
- Digital origination (SelfeLoans) and liability products can improve scale and fee income — important incremental growth levers.  
- Execution risk remains: conversion of leads, underwriting in new geographies, and maintaining cost discipline are unproven at scale.  
- Given potential for double‑digit growth and scalable channels, growth potential scores higher.

#### Corporate Governance: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding | 0.00% (post‑merger structure) |
| Notable public holders | Ashish Dhawan ~3.7%, IFC ~2.9% |
| ESOP activity | Large ESOP issuances across 2023–25; ESOP cost recognized |
| Regulatory actions | RBI penalty ₹65 lakh (Feb) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management transparency: proactive provisioning, regular concall guidance and clear strategy — positive.  
- Promoter structure (0% promoter stake after corporate restructuring) is atypical for Indian banks; absence of a high‑skin‑in‑the‑game promoter is a structural governance point to monitor.  
- Significant ESOP issuance in recent periods (material expense and dilution) — needs monitoring for shareholder dilution and executive compensation alignment.  
- No material unresolved regulatory breach; single modest RBI penalty noted — governance broadly acceptable but not pristine.

#### Research Reports: 6/10

| Report (sample, last 12 months) | Broker | Recommendation | Target |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------------|--------|
| Research update (10 Aug 2025) | ICICI Securities | HOLD | ₹57 |
| Initiation / update (01 May 2025) | Motilal Oswal | BUY | ₹77 |
| Update (09 Aug 2025) | Emkay | REDUCE | ₹55 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Active analyst coverage with divergent views reflects uncertainty: some see value (BUY), others caution (HOLD/REDUCE).  
- Latest ICICI HOLD target (~₹57) aligns with our realistic view; Motilal bullish scenario assumes faster recovery and re‑rating.  
- Research consensus shows limited near‑term upside but material mid‑term upside if asset quality normalises.  
- Quality of research is good; heterogeneity in views signals execution & asset‑quality risk.

#### Technical Analysis: 3/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current price vs SMAs | Trading below 5/10/20/50/100/200 SMAs |
| RSI (14) | 23.95 (oversold) |
| MACD | Negative (bearish) |
| Pivot point / Support levels | Pivot ~₹50.89; Support S1 ~₹49.58, S2 ~₹48.90 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is below all major moving averages (short and long) — technical picture is bearish.  
- Momentum oscillators uniformly weak; MACD negative and multiple oscillators in bearish territory.  
- RSI indicates oversold — short‑term bounce possible but trend remains down.  
- Volatility elevated and stock recently formed new 52‑week low — technical setup favors caution.

#### Market Sentiments: 5/10

| Recent sentiment drivers | Impact |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Q1 FY26 one‑off provisioning & net loss (Aug 2025) | Negative — triggered price weakness |
| Capital actions (Tier‑II NCDs ₹500 Cr; planned Tier‑I raise ₹1,250 Cr) | Mixed — strengthens capital but dilutive/market‑sensitive |
| Broker coverage (mixed) | Neutral — divergent analyst views |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Market reaction to Q1 provisioning and reported loss was negative – stock hit 52‑week low.  
- Capital raises (Tier‑II/NCD and planned Tier‑I) are viewed positively for solvency but create near‑term dilution concerns and execution risk.  
- News flow around deposit traction, digital product traction and management guidance provides constructive counterbalance.  
- Overall sentiment is mixed — market pricing reflects uncertainty.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Holder Category | Latest (Jun 2025) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Promoters | 0.00% |
| FIIs | ~16.3% |
| DIIs | ~47.1% |
| Public / Others | ~36.6% |
| Notable names | Ashish Dhawan (~3.7%), IFC (~2.9%), HDFC MF (8.6%) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong institutional interest: healthy DII ownership (mutual funds/insurers) and reputable FIIs presence — supportive for stability.  
- Presence of marquee investors (Ashish Dhawan, IFC) is a positive signal for corporate credibility.  
- Promoter 0% is unusual and should be monitored for strategic alignment and stewardship.  
- Recent large ESOP issuances and active institutional rebalancing are notable and can affect future supply/demand dynamics.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Peer | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE% |
|------|--------------------|-----:|---------:|-----:|
| AU Small Finance | 53,541.53 | 24.5 | 3.11 | 14.2 |
| Ujjivan Small | 8,264.00 | 15.6 | 1.36 | 12.4 |
| Equitas SFB (self) | 5,733.00 | — | 0.94 | 2.43 |
| Jana Small Fin | 5,162.95 | 11.9 | 1.25 | 13.0 |
| Fino Payments | 2,338.02 | 27.2 | 3.13 | 13.3 |

Median (peer set) shows P/B ~0.95 and ROE ~10.4%. Equitas trades cheaper on P/B but reports much lower ROE currently, underscoring a value vs execution tradeoff.

## Key Strengths
- Strong capital buffer (CRAR ~20%); liquidity metrics robust (LCR well above regulatory minimum).  
- Fast deposit mobilisation and improving liability mix (CASA ~29% and retail deposit growth).  
- Strategic re‑allocation toward secured, higher‑quality loan segments (SBL, housing, used vehicles).  
- Active digital origination channel (SelfeLoans) and product expansion (NR deposits, forex, cards).  
- Institutional investor base and credible analyst coverage provide liquidity and monitoring.

## Key Concerns  
- Near‑term earnings hit from aggressive, upfront provisioning (Q1 FY26 loss ₹224 Cr); TTM PAT negative.  
- Residual MFI and MSE stress pockets — credit cost remains the primary re‑rating risk.  
- NIM compression due to higher cost of funds and mix shift away from higher‑yield MFI.  
- Promoter stake structure unusual (0%) after corporate reorganisation; heavy ESOP issuances raise dilution/agency questions.  
- Technical momentum weak and stock underperforming markets.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹76  
**Timeline:** 18 months  
**Key Drivers:** Rapid normalisation of MFI collections; credit cost falls toward normalized levels; secured‑loan growth accelerates (20%+), NIM stabilizes; market restores a 1.3× P/ABV multiple as earnings recover and PCR remains adequate. Upside driven by both ABV growth and multiple expansion.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹57  
**Timeline:** 12 months  
**Key Drivers:** Management delivers guided advance growth (15–16% FY26), asset quality stabilises with credit cost falling from peak, P/B expands modestly to ~1.07× on improved sentiment and maintained CRAR. This TP aligns with recent broker HOLD targets and represents moderate re‑rating as fundamentals recover.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹42  
**Timeline:** 12 months  
**Key Drivers:** Continued MFI stress and additional provisioning; NIM compression persists with slower deposit repricing benefits; Tier‑I raise timing/dilution concerns; multiple compression to ~0.8× ABV. Results in downside risk >15%.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP (₹50.27) | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|-----------------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹76 | +51% | Strong operational recovery and multiple expansion — high upside but execution‑dependent |
| Realistic | ₹57 | +13.4% | Balanced recovery; modest re‑rating — aligns with HOLD (0–15% upside) |
| Pessimistic | ₹42 | -16.4% | Continued stress scenario — downside risk material |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** HOLD (12 months) — realistic scenario gives modest upside (~13%), but near‑term execution and asset‑quality risks mean we do not recommend accumulation for fresh large positions now.  
- **Risk‑Reward Assessment:** Reward vs risk is balanced: potential ≈+13% (realistic) vs downside ≈‑16% (pessimistic). This asymmetric near‑term profile favors a wait‑and‑watch approach for new investors and selective trimming / risk management for existing holders.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Range | Stop Loss | Target (Realistic) | Position Size (Portfolio) | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|------------:|---------:|-------------------:|--------------------------:|---------:|
| HOLD | Tactical / Selective Accumulation | ₹48 — ₹52 | ₹40 (strict) | ₹57 (12 months) | 1–3% (new) / 2–5% (existing) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Maintain HOLD: capital and deposit franchise are strong and management is executing a sensible de‑risking strategy, but near‑term profitability is impaired by elevated provisioning and NIM pressure.  
- For risk‑tolerant investors: consider selective accumulation in tranches if price dips near pessimistic support (~₹40–45) or if Q2/Q3 FY26 shows clear recovery in credit cost and NIM.  
- For existing holders: reduce position if value falls below ₹40 or if PCR / asset‑quality metrics deteriorate further; otherwise hold to realize mid‑term recovery.

## Investment Thesis
1. Equitas is transitioning from an MFI‑heavy book to a secured, granular loan mix (SBL, used vehicles, housing) — this strategically reduces structural cyclicality and should support steadier long‑term ROAs.  
2. The bank has strong capital and liquidity (CRAR ~20.5%, LCR well above regulatory minima) which gives it room to absorb provisioning shocks and fund growth.  
3. Near‑term earnings are constrained by upfront provisioning for MFI stress; recovery of collections and normalization of credit cost are the key re‑rating catalysts.  
4. Valuation is reasonable on P/B basis (0.94x) but requires earnings recovery for multiple expansion; negative TTM EPS makes pure P/E comparisons irrelevant currently.  
5. Execution risk (underwriting in newer secured segments, managing ESOP dilution, and delivering deposit cost improvements) dictates a cautious stance — watch Q2/Q3 FY26 results for confirmation.
