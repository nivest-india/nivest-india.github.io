### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Global Vectra Helicorp Ltd (GLOBALVECT) |
| **Sector** | Helicopter Services / Miscellaneous Transportation |
| **Current Price** | ₹209 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹293 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- Helicopter services in India serve offshore oil & gas crew transfers, onshore utility & survey work, religious tourism (pilgrimage), emergency services and MRO — demand is tied to energy capex cycles and tourism flows.  
- High regulatory and safety barriers (DGCA/ICAO compliance) limit new entrants and support incumbents with strong safety records.  
- Revenue is lumpy/seasonal (pilgrimage seasons, oil & gas exploration cycles) and large contracts (1–10 years) are common, providing revenue visibility for contract winners.  
- Input-cost sensitivity (jet fuel, maintenance, lease rentals) and high fixed asset intensity (aircraft depreciation) make margins volatile.  
- Fragmented competitive landscape in onshore services, few national private players in offshore/crew-change segment — Global Vectra is the largest private helicopter operator in India by scale.

## Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Primary end-markets | Oil & Gas crew transfer, Pilgrimage/Tourism, Government & Utility services |
| Structural barriers | High (safety, certifications, MRO capability) |
| Cyclicality | Medium‑High (linked to oil prices & tourism seasons) |
| Competitive intensity | Low-to-moderate (few large private operators) |
| Long-term visibility | Good where long-term contracts exist (1–10 years) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Global Vectra benefits from structural entry barriers (DGCA/ICAO compliance, safety record >2.6 lakh accident‑free hours) — this supports an above-average sector score.  
- Large, mission‑critical clients (ONGC, Reliance, Oil India, Baker Hughes etc.) provide sticky contract opportunities and revenue visibility where awarded.  
- Sector demand is cyclical — a downturn in oil & gas capex or lower pilgrimage volumes can depress utilisation and margins.  
- Growth outside Oil & Gas (pilgrimage, MRO, inspection) diversifies revenue and reduces single-market dependence.  
- Overall, sector fundamentals support a stable mid‑to‑high score but cyclicality limits a top rating.

#### Financial Strength: 4/10

| Metric | Latest |
|--------|--------|
| Sales (TTM) | ₹531 Cr |
| Operating profit (TTM, approx. EBITDA) | ₹49 Cr |
| Net profit (TTM) | ₹-4 Cr |
| Cash from operations (FY25) | ₹98 Cr |
| Borrowings (Mar 2025) | ₹461 Cr |
| Debt / Equity | 21.7 |
| Quick ratio | 0.43 |
| Current ratio | 0.51 |
| Interest coverage | 0.97 |
| ROCE | 7.1% |
| ROE | -3.02% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Operating cash generation has been solid recently (Cash from operations FY24: ₹111 Cr; FY25: ₹98 Cr), which is positive for servicing obligations and capex.  
- EBITDA (operating profit) is positive (TTM ~₹49 Cr), showing underlying operating capability despite PAT volatility.  
- Profitability after depreciation and interest is weak/volatile: TTM net loss (~₹-4 Cr) and ROE negative — depreciation (fleet) and finance costs weigh heavily.  
- Leverage and liquidity are clear weaknesses: high borrowings (₹461 Cr), low current/quick ratios and interest cover <1 raise solvency and refinancing risk in a higher‑rate environment.  
- Overall: operating cashflows provide some cushion, but balance sheet leverage and weak PAT metrics materially lower financial strength.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price to Book (P/BV) | 13.8x |
| Book value (per share) | ₹15.2 |
| EV / EBITDA | 7.51x |
| Market Cap / Sales | 0.55x (₹293 Cr / ₹531 Cr) |
| Peer median EV/EBITDA | 12.26x |

**Score Reasoning:**
- EV/EBITDA (7.51x) is below the peer median (≈12.3x), implying a relative valuation discount on an enterprise‑value basis — potential value if EBITDA is sustained/improved.  
- P/B is high (≈13.8x) because book value is very small (BV per share ≈₹15), making PBV appear expensive despite low EV multiples. PBV is not the right comparator for asset‑intensive, high‑depreciation aviation businesses.  
- P/E is not meaningful (negative/volatile EPS). Relative EV/EBITDA is the more appropriate metric for this sector (asset + lease structure).  
- The mixed signals (cheap on EV/EBITDA; expensive on PBV; negative EPS) require caution — valuation looks attractive only if EBITDA stabilises and balance sheet risk is contained.  
- Given the EV/EBITDA discount vs peers, valuation is moderately attractive for a turnaround/recovery case — hence a mid rating.

#### Growth Potential: 6/10

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Sales growth (3Y CAGR) | 17.4% |
| Sales growth (5Y CAGR) | 3.5% |
| Sources of growth | Offshore crew transfer, Pilgrimage, MRO, govt contracts |
| Order visibility | Long-term contracts (1–10 years) for key clients |
| Fleet expansion / leases | Mix of owned & leased fleet; lease strategy can drive growth with lower upfront capex |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Revenue shows recovery and mid‑teens short‑term CAGR (3Y ~17%), reflecting demand pick-up — positive for growth potential.  
- Long‑term contracts with major oil & gas players provide recurring revenue if contract awards are retained.  
- MRO and pilgrim operations provide incremental, higher-margin revenue opportunities and de‑risk dependence on a single vertical.  
- Growth is constrained by asset intensity (helicopter acquisition / leases) and dependency on cyclical end markets; margin expansion depends on utilisation and lease vs own fleet mix.  
- Overall: moderate growth potential—company can scale with better utilisation and contract wins, but downside if oil & gas activity weakens.

#### Corporate Governance: 5/10

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Promoter holding | 75.0% |
| Pledge status | 0.0% pledged |
| Recent governance events | Warning for late director appointment disclosure (Sep 2024); CEO changes (resignation Nov 2024; appointment Aug 2024) |
| Dividend policy | No dividends since 2018 |
| Audit / compliance | Regular filings; secretarial auditor changes noted |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High promoter holding (75%) signals promoter alignment and stability, and no pledging is positive.  
- Governance lapses have occurred (regulatory warning for late director appointment disclosure) and management turnover (CEO changes) — these are governance negatives that need monitoring.  
- Lack of dividend or shareholder returns reduces attractiveness for income investors; capital allocation appears focused on operations/capex.  
- Credit rating updates (CARE / Brickwork) indicate active engagement with rating agencies; no large public governance scandals detected.  
- Net: promoter strength partially offsets operational governance slips — mid score reflects mixed evidence.

#### Research Reports: 5/10

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Broker coverage | Limited / patchy coverage over past 12 months |
| Public analyst notes | Few available; primary coverage via market news & credit rating releases |
| Credit ratings | CARE / Brickwork updates in 2023–2024 |
| Recent research access | No comprehensive broker equity reports available in public domain at time of analysis |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Equity analyst coverage is limited; recent broker research PDFs were not broadly available, restricting third‑party model checks.  
- Credit rating notes from CARE and Brickwork provide debt/credit perspectives and are useful for balance sheet assessment.  
- In absence of detailed equity research, default mid score (5) applied, with reliance on company filings, quarterly results and credit commentary.  
- Investors should treat coverage gap as a risk — fewer sell‑side checks increase information asymmetry.

#### Technical Analysis: 4/10

| Metric | Latest |
|--------|--------|
| Current price vs 50DMA | Below 50DMA (50DMA ~₹227) |
| Current price vs 200DMA | Below 200DMA (200DMA ~₹238) |
| Momentum indicators | RSI ~38 (neutral‑to‑slightly oversold); MACD negative |
| Moving average signals | Trading below 8/8 SMAs and EMAs (bearish) |
| Volume profile | Periodic high-volume spikes; recent delivery % mixed |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short‑ and medium‑term technicals are bearish — stock trading below key moving averages and multiple oscillators in bearish territory.  
- RSI ~38 suggests the stock is not deeply oversold but momentum is weak. MACD below signal and center line is a negative confirmation.  
- Long‑term price performance (3‑5 year CAGR strong) shows earlier appreciation — technical weakness appears concentrated in the last 6–12 months (recent correction from 52‑week high ~₹345).  
- Volume spikes indicate episodic spec interest but not sustained buying conviction.  
- Technicals do not support near‑term momentum trades; look for a stabilization above 50DMA/200DMA before trend reversal.

#### Market Sentiments: 5/10

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Recent news flow | Mixed (quarterly earnings volatility; board/management changes) |
| Sentiment drivers | Quarterly profit variability, high leverage, safety credentials |
| Institutional interest | Very low FII/DII presence (FIIs ~0.08% recently) |
| Retail interest | Public float ~25% with increasing retail shareholder count |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Market sentiment is mixed — recent quarters show pockets of profit (quarteral swings) but overall earnings volatility keeps sentiment cautious.  
- Institutional participation is minimal (FIIs negligible), which reduces stabilizing demand from large investors.  
- Positive safety credentials and long-term contracts support strategic sentiment among clients, but investor sentiment is cautious due to leverage and governance items.  
- News items (CEO changes, regulatory warning) have kept sentiment neutral‑to‑negative in short term.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 7/10

| Metric | Latest |
|--------|--------|
| Promoters | 75.00% |
| FIIs | 0.08% (Jun 2025) |
| Public / Others | ~25.0% |
| Notable public investor(s) | Vijay Kishanlal Kedia ~3.0% |
| Shareholder count | ~17,311 (Jun 2025) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High promoter stake (75%) is positive — indicates promoter skin in the game and reduces risk of sudden control changes.  
- No promoter pledge reported — positive for governance and creditor confidence.  
- Low FII / institutional share limits institutional support and liquidity from large funds.  
- Increase in public shareholder count suggests retail interest, but low institutional footprint increases volatility risk.  
- Overall a favorable ownership structure for long‑term stability but lower institutional validation.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Company | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | EV/EBITDA | CMP / BV | ROE (%) | Debt / Eq |
|--------|--------------------:|----------:|---------:|--------:|----------:|
| Interglobe Aviation | 218,243.33 | 12.26 | 23.44 | 103.8 | 7.21 |
| SpiceJet | 5,214.02 | 9.32 | 7.63 | — | 6.17 |
| FlySBS Aviation | 1,119.73 | 26.26 | — | 26.22 | 0.12 |
| TAAL Enterprises | 991.28 | 12.49 | 4.86 | 24.34 | 0.02 |
| Global Vectra | 293.22 | 7.51 | 13.79 | -3.02 | 21.69 |

Median (5 co.) EV/EBITDA ≈ 12.26x; Global Vectra trades materially below median EV/EBITDA while having a high PBV driven by a very low book value per share.

## Key Strengths
- Market leader among private helicopter operators in India with long‑term client relationships in Oil & Gas.  
- Strong safety record and certifications (ISO 9001/14001/45001) — important for contract renewals.  
- Diversified service lines (offshore/onshore transport, pilgrim operations, MRO, utility inspection) providing multiple revenue streams.  
- Positive operating cash generation in recent years (FY24: ₹111 Cr; FY25: ₹98 Cr) despite accounting net losses.  
- No promoter pledged shares and high promoter holding (75%) — alignment with shareholders.

## Key Concerns  
- High leverage and weak liquidity (Borrowings ~₹461 Cr; Net working capital ratios weak; interest coverage <1).  
- Earnings volatility: negative PAT on TTM basis and high depreciation expense due to fleet.  
- Limited institutional (FII/DII) ownership and patchy sell‑side coverage increase information and liquidity risk.  
- Governance slip (late director appointment disclosure warning) and management turnover — needs monitoring.  
- Valuation signals mixed (cheap on EV/EBITDA vs peers; expensive on P/B because of very low book value).

## Scenario Analysis

Note: share count implied for targets = Market Cap / Price = ₹293 Cr / ₹209 ≈ 1.402 Crore shares (used to convert equity value ↔ per‑share price).

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹464 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** EBITDA recovery to ~₹70 Cr (higher utilisation, oil & gas activity recovery, better pilgrim season), EV/EBITDA multiple expansion to ~10x (re‑rating as debt metrics improve), partial net‑debt reduction via cash generation/asset optimisation.  
Reasoning (math): EV = 10 × ₹70 Cr = ₹700 Cr. Assume net debt reduced to ₹50 Cr → equity value ≈ ₹650 Cr. Per‑share price = ₹650 Cr / 1.402 Cr shares ≈ ₹464. Upside ≈ +122% vs CMP.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹260 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Modest EBITDA improvement to ~₹55 Cr (utilisation improvement, stable contract renewals), modest multiple expansion to ~8x as sentiment stabilizes. Net debt ~market‑implied level (₹75 Cr).  
Reasoning (math): EV = 8 × ₹55 Cr = ₹440 Cr. Equity value = ₹440 Cr − ₹75 Cr = ₹365 Cr. Per‑share price = ₹365 Cr / 1.402 Cr ≈ ₹260. Upside ≈ +24% vs CMP.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹100 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Demand softness, contract losses or utilisation drop, EBITDA falls to ~₹40 Cr and multiple compresses to ~6x; net debt increases to ~₹100 Cr due to cash burn — equity valuation materially down.  
Reasoning (math): EV = 6 × ₹40 Cr = ₹240 Cr. Equity value = ₹240 Cr − ₹100 Cr = ₹140 Cr. Per‑share price = ₹140 Cr / 1.402 Cr ≈ ₹100. Downside ≈ −52% vs CMP.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|--------------:|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹464 | +122% | Strong execution and multiple expansion |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹260 | +24% | Modest EBITDA recovery and modest re‑rating |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹100 | -52% | Demand shock / balance sheet deterioration |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (based on realistic scenario target showing ~+24% upside vs CMP).  
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Moderate-to-attractive upside (24% realistic) but material downside risk in stress scenarios (~-52%). Recommendation is conditional — suitable for investors who can tolerate execution and balance‑sheet risk and who size positions accordingly.

## Investment Recommendation

| Field | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Recommendation | BUY |
| Strategy | Recovery / value play — buy selectively on dips and monitor leverage metrics |
| Entry price range | ₹200 – ₹230 |
| Stop loss | ₹170 (protect capital if balance‑sheet or utilisation cues worsen) |
| Target price | ₹260 (primary realistic target, 12 months) |
| Position size | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) — increase only if leverage/interest cover improves |
| Timeline | 12 months (monitor quarterly results and debt metrics) |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- The company trades at an attractive EV/EBITDA vs peers and generates positive operating cash flows — implying upside if EBITDA stabilises and net debt is controlled.  
- Material balance sheet and profitability risks exist (high leverage, interest cover <1); therefore position sizing should be conservative.  
- BUY stance is a tactical recommendation expecting operational stability and modest re‑rating; investors should watch quarterly cashflow, contract wins/renewals and any debt‑restructuring progress.

## Investment Thesis
- Market leader in private helicopter services in India with established client base in Oil & Gas and diversified onshore revenue streams.  
- Recent quarter & TTM operating cashflows show ability to generate cash (FY24: ₹111 Cr; FY25: ₹98 Cr), supporting debt servicing if sustained.  
- Valuation presents a selective opportunity on EV/EBITDA basis (7.5x) vs peers (median ~12x) — re‑rating can produce meaningful upside.  
- Key risks are high leverage, weak interest coverage and earnings volatility due to depreciation and cyclical demand. Balance‑sheet repair or improved interest coverage is the primary catalyst.  
- Recommended as a recovery/value trade with medium position sizing and strict monitoring of leverage/liquidity indicators.
