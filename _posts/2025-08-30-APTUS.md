### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Aptus Value Housing Finance India Ltd (APTUS) |
| **Sector** | Housing Finance / Financial Services |
| **Current Price** | ₹318 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹15,899 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- The affordable and low‑/middle‑income housing segment in India remains under‑penetrated with a large addressable market (company presentations estimate an addressable pool in the ~Rs 1.5 trillion range for targeted geographies), giving HFCs room for sustained multi‑year growth.
- Policy support (PMAY and related affordable housing schemes) and improving rural/semi‑urban incomes underpin demand for first‑time home buyers — Aptus’ target customer segment.
- Competitive intensity is increasing: banks, small finance banks (SFBs) and larger NBFC‑HFCs are expanding in semi‑urban markets; pricing pressure and customer retention will be key differentiators.
- Funding and interest‑rate cycles matter: rating upgrades and repo reductions materially help funding costs for HFCs; companies with diversified, long‑tenor funding see margin benefits first.
- Technology adoption (mobile LOS, e‑KYC, e‑NACH) is lowering cost‑to‑serve and enabling scale; HFCs that combine branch distribution + digital origination capture market share faster.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Addressable market (company estimate) | ~Rs 1,500 Cr (indicative from investor presentation) |
| Housing finance penetration (sector) | Under‑penetrated (structural growth runway) |
| Policy tailwinds | PMAY / affordable housing support (positive) |
| Competitive intensity | Rising (banks / SFBs / NBFCs) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Large under‑penetrated market where Aptus focuses (Tier‑3/4 and self‑employed borrowers) — structural growth opportunity remains intact.
- Government affordable‑housing programs and continued urbanisation provide durable demand for first‑time home loans.
- Competitive pressure is real (banks, SFBs, fintechs), but Aptus’ branch + digital model and LIG focus provide a defendable niche.
- Interest‑rate/funding environment is the key sector risk; rating upgrades and repo cuts materially reduce funding costs and improve spreads for well‑rated HFCs.
- Overall sector quality is good for players who combine disciplined underwriting and diversified funding.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Metric | Latest (consol) |
|--------|-----------------|
| AUM | ₹11,267 Cr (Q1 FY26) |
| Net worth / Equity | ~₹4,415 Cr (Jun 2025) |
| Total borrowings | ~₹7,101 Cr (Jun 2025) |
| Debt / Equity | 1.59x (reported metric) |
| Liquidity buffer | ~₹1,531 Cr (cash + undrawn sanctions, Q1 FY26) |
| ROA / ROE | ROA ~7.7% / ROE ~18.6% (FY25 / TTM range) |
| GNPA / NNPA | GNPA 1.19% (FY25) / NNPA 0.89% (FY25); Q1 FY26 GNPA rose seasonally to 1.49% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong profitability metrics (ROE ≈18.5%, ROA ~7.7%) indicate high returns on capital and efficient business model vs peers.
- Conservative capital position: very high capital adequacy (~70% CAR reported) and a sizeable liquidity buffer (~₹1,500+ Cr) reduce funding / ALM risk.
- Leverage moderate for HFC (Debt/Equity ~1.6x); borrowing tenure long and funding mix diversified (banks / NHB / NCDs / securitisation).
- Asset quality remains good in absolute terms (GNPA/NNPA sub‑2%), but recent seasonal uptick (Q1 FY26) requires monitoring.
- Cash flow dynamics reflect rapid loan book growth (operating cash outflow due to loan origination) — typical for growing HFCs; liquidity and access to diversified funding are key mitigants.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Aptus (consol) | Peer median |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Price / Earnings (P/E) | 19.9x |
| Price / Book (P/BV) | 3.68x |
| EV / EBITDA | 13.7x |
| ROE | 18.6% |
| Dividend yield | 1.42% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- On P/E (~20x) Aptus is roughly in line with the peer median P/E (~19.8x); earnings growth supports a fair multiple.
- P/B is at a premium (3.7x vs peer median ~1.9x) — market is paying for higher ROE and growth; premium leaves less margin for execution risk.
- EV/EBITDA modestly above peer median (13.7x vs ~12.2x) — reasonable but not cheap.
- Dividend yield and payout (≈30%) are shareholder friendly but not enough to offset premium valuation.
- Valuation is fair‑to‑slightly rich vs peers; downside exists if asset quality or funding costs surprise.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value / Guidance |
|--------|------------------|
| AUM (FY25 → Q1 FY26) | ₹10,865 Cr → ₹11,267 Cr (FY25 AUM ≈₹10,865 Cr; Q1 FY26 ₹11,267 Cr) |
| Disbursement run‑rate (Q1 FY26) | ~₹775 Cr / quarter |
| Management AUM target | ₹25,000 Cr by FY28‑29 |
| Branch expansion | 35–40 new branches per year (management guidance) |
| Digital adoption | ~20–25% origination via digital channels (growing) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Historical AUM growth 25–30% YoY (5‑year CAGR ~28–30%) — demonstrated ability to scale.
- Management guidance for continued double‑digit disbursement and AUM growth (mid‑20s %) appears credible given liquidity, CRAR and branch pipeline.
- Digital LOS + in‑house collection model supports scalable, lower cost growth and better underwriting control.
- Growth risks: execution in new states (Maharashtra / Odisha), field‑level attrition and rising competition could slow organic growth.
- If funding cost falls (rating benefits, market conditions), NIM and PAT can expand materially, supporting multiple expansion.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Promoter holding | 40.37% (Jun 2025) after stake changes |
| Board / Management changes | New Executive Chairman & MD appointed in 2023; experienced management |
| Dividend / payout policy | Regular interim dividends (₹2–2.5 per share in FY24–25) |
| ESOP activity | Active ESOP issuance (regular allotments reported) |
| Audit / disclosures | Clean reports; regular investor concalls and presentations |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Transparent disclosures: frequent investor presentations, concalls, audited annual reports and rating agency interactions demonstrate good IR practices.
- Regular dividends and defined capital targets show shareholder orientation; payout ratio (~30%) indicates disciplined capital allocation.
- Promoter holding fell materially (WestBridge partial sale) in mid‑2025 — not necessarily negative but reduces single large promoter influence; larger FII ownership has risen.
- ESOP issuance is significant — good for retention but is a potential dilution consideration.
- No material governance red flags (no audit qualifications), but watch promoter/large investor stake changes and high ESOP activity.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Metric | Coverage & Tone |
|--------|-----------------|
| Analyst coverage | Multiple broker notes and investor presentations over the past 12 months |
| Recent analyst stance | Generally constructive / Buy / Positive (subject to valuation) |
| Key analyst concerns | Asset quality watch, funding costs, geographic concentration |
| Key analyst positives | ROE, NIM, scalability, rating upgrades |

**Score Reasoning:**
- There is consistent analyst coverage over the past 12 months (quarterly notes and presentation analyses); most research notes highlight strong ROE and growth runway.
- Analysts have highlighted the same risks we note: GNPA uptick and funding cost sensitivity.
- Coverage provides a balanced set of bears/bull viewpoints, with many analysts backing a Buy with targets based on earnings acceleration.
- Absence of any major negative sell‑side reports or forensic concerns supports middling‑to‑positive score.

#### Technical Analysis: 5/10

| Metric | Current technical read |
|--------|------------------------|
| Price vs 50 DMA | Price (₹318) < 50 DMA (~₹337) |
| Price vs 200 DMA | Price (₹318) slightly below 200 DMA (~₹326) |
| RSI (14) | ~34 (near oversold) |
| Moving averages | Trading below most short/medium EMAs and SMAs |
| Momentum | Neutral to weak in short term |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short‑term technical indicators are weak: stock trades below most SMAs/EMAs and MACD/oscillators show negative bias.
- RSI close to oversold levels (low‑risk buying zone if fundamentals intact), but oscillator mix indicates limited short‑term upside.
- Longer time frames (6–12 months) show reasonable support and prior multi‑year performance; technicals are neutral‑to‑cautious for tactical entry.
- Volume spikes during news/events indicate institutional activity; watch for confirmation via price recovery with volume.

#### Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Metric | Recent Sentiment Signals |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Credit rating | Upgrades to CARE AA (recent) — positive |
| Institutional flows | FIIs and mutual funds increased positions in 2025 (material inflows) |
| News flow | Positive (dividend history, rating upgrades, good quarterly earnings) |
| Short‑term fear | Q1 seasonality in GNPA caused some market caution |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent rating upgrades and steady dividend payouts along with healthy quarterly results have created a constructive market narrative.
- Institutional inflows (increased FII / DII ownership) support sentiment and liquidity in the stock.
- Short‑term noise (seasonal GNPA uptick, promoter stake changes) has produced volatility; overall bias remains positive-to-neutral.
- Sentiment sensitive to fund‑rate trajectory and any surprise deterioration in asset quality.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Holder Category | Jun 2025 |
|-----------------|----------|
| Promoters | 40.37% |
| FIIs | 30.41% |
| DIIs | 16.04% |
| Public / Others | 13.19% |
| Notable changes | WestBridge stake reduction in mid‑2025; FII increase |

**Score Reasoning:**
- A meaningful promoter stake reduction (part sale by a large investor) in 2025 reduced promoter % from earlier levels; this is material and should be tracked for intent (profit taking vs strategic exit).
- Institutional shareholding (FIIs + DIIs) has risen materially — positive for liquidity and governance oversight.
- Promoter holding remains sizeable (~40%) and management continuity appears intact.
- Active ESOP issuance increases potential dilution risk and requires monitoring.
- Overall mixed: institutional validation but material change in promoter composition reduces score slightly.

(Comparative metrics show Aptus trades at a premium P/B vs median; earnings multiple in line with median; ROE is above median; leverage lower than peer median.)

## Key Strengths
- Strong and consistent profitability: ROE ≈18–20% and ROA ~7–8% with industry‑leading margins (NIM ~13%).
- Demonstrated high growth: AUM growth mid‑20s % YoY and management guidance to continue robust expansion.
- Conservative balance sheet and liquidity: CAR ≈70% and substantial cash + undrawn bank lines (~₹1,500+ Cr).
- Scalable operating model: Mobile‑first LOS, high digital adoption and in‑house collections reduce customer acquisition and collection risks.
- Recent credit rating upgrades improve funding access and reduce incremental borrowing costs.

## Key Concerns  
- Asset quality: GNPA uptick (seasonal) to 1.49% in Q1 FY26 — needs monitoring for trend emergence.
- Valuation premium on P/B and moderate EV/EBITDA leave limited margin for execution missteps.
- Promoter/large shareholder changes (WestBridge stake reduction) and active ESOP issuance (potential dilution) are governance items to watch.
- Competitive pressure in semi‑urban markets may compress yields over time if episode intensifies.
- Funding cost sensitivity: although ratings and repo cuts are helpful, a sustained higher rate environment would compress spreads.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹520 (18 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Faster AUM scaling (30–35% YoY), NIM stability or modest improvement (benefit of rating upgrade and lower cost of funds), higher PAT growth (30–40%), and multiple expansion driven by market re‑rating to a premium P/E (~22–26x) given sustained ROE above 18% and improved asset diversification. Execution of Maharashtra/Odisha expansion is smooth with asset quality intact.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹400 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management achieves mid‑20s % AUM growth (24–28%), NIM remains ~12.5–13%, PAT grows ~20–25%, and market assigns a P/E in line with current levels (≈20x) to slightly higher (20–22x) reflecting stable performance. This translates to EPS ~₹20 (FY26) and a fair price ~₹400.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹246 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Slower growth (AUM growth slips to <10–12%), GNPA deterioration or higher credit costs lead to earnings stress, and market multiple compresses to low‑teens (P/E ~14x) on sector/stock de‑rating. Funding cost remains elevated, compressing NIM and ROA declines — valuation re‑rating downward.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP (₹318) | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|---------------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹520 | +63.5% | Best case: execution + margin expansion + multiple re‑rating |
| Realistic | ₹400 | +25.8% | Most likely: sustained growth, stable margins, modest re‑rating |
| Pessimistic | ₹246 | -22.6% | Downside: credit / funding stress and multiple compression |

Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:
- Primary Recommendation: BUY (based on realistic scenario upside of ~26% over 12 months).
- Risk‑Reward Assessment: Upside potential of ~26% vs downside risk ~23% in stressed scenario. Given strong financials, healthy capital, and credible growth plan, the risk/reward is favorable for a medium‑to‑long term allocation, subject to monitoring asset quality and funding trends.

## Investment Recommendation

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|
| Recommendation | BUY |
| Strategy Type | Core long‑term (12 months) |
| Suggested Entry Price Range | ₹300 – ₹335 |
| Stop Loss | ₹270 (strict cut; reassess if liquidity/support breaks) |
| Primary Target (12 months) | ₹400 |
| Alternate upside target (18 months) | ₹520 (optimistic) |
| Position Size (Suggested) | Medium — 3–5% of portfolio (5% allocation for investors with moderate risk appetite) |
| Time Horizon | 12–18 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Aptus combines industry‑leading ROE/NIM, credible growth execution (branch + digital), strong liquidity and conservative capital — a favorable base for compounding.
- Rating upgrades and diversified funding reduce cost of incremental borrowings, supporting margin resilience.
- Valuation is fair on P/E though premium on P/B; realistic target assumes earnings growth will justify current multiples.
- Key risks (GNPA uptick, promoter stake change, funding cost sensitivity) are monitorable; stop loss and staged accumulation recommended.

## Investment Thesis
1. High‑quality growth: Aptus has delivered consistent double‑digit AUM and profit growth with disciplined underwriting focused on first‑time, self‑employed borrowers in semi‑urban India.
2. Industry‑leading profitability: ROE ~18–20% and NIM ~13% indicate a differentiated, high‑margin model relative to many peers.
3. Strong balance sheet & liquidity: CAR ~70% and a large liquidity cushion reduce execution and funding risks for the aggressive branch expansion plan.
4. Execution catalysts: Digital LOS, branch expansion into Maharashtra/Odisha, and higher digital sourcing should sustain growth and enable cost efficiencies.
5. Key risk‑control: Asset quality (GNPA/coverage) and funding cost are the two variables that will determine whether Aptus achieves premium valuation or faces re‑rating.
