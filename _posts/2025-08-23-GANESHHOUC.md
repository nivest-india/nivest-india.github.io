### Company Overview

| Metric | Value
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Ganesh Housing Limited (GANESHHOUC)
| **Sector** | Real Estate — Residential & Commercial (Ahmedabad-focused)
| **Current Price** | ₹900
| **Market Cap** | ₹7,504 Cr
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-23

### Industry Overview

- Ahmedabad is a high‑growth, affordability‑driven residential market with growing commercial/IT leasing demand (spillover from GIFT City); local affordability supports sustained demand for mid‑to‑premium housing.
- Office leasing (GC/IT/SSC demand) is recovering; developers with SEZ/commercial exposure (like GANESHHOUC’s Million Minds) can capture annuity income and diversify risk.
- Sector remains cyclical — interest‑rate sensitivity and regulatory/tax changes can compress sales velocity and launch timing; high quality projects and branded developers tend to outperform in downcycles.
- Technology (pre‑cast construction, i‑homes) and tight balance‑sheet management are differentiators; companies that can deliver on time and monetize land banks will capture premium pricing.
- Over next 3–5 years, expect mid‑single to high‑single digit industry volume growth in established cities, with premium/commercial segments outpacing mass residential growth.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Key Areas | Assessment
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | 8–12% p.a. (estimate for established metros over 3–5 yrs)
| Market Size | ₹60,000 Cr (Ahmedabad market estimate)
| Sector Tailwinds | Urbanisation, GIFT City spillovers, corporate leasing demand
| Sector Headwinds | Cyclicality, rate sensitivity, regulatory risks
| Policy Support | Neutral to positive (state incentives for IT/commercial)
| Competition Level | Medium (local + national entrants increasing)
| Technology Disruption | Positive (precast, modular, automation)

**Score Reasoning:**
- Ahmedabad’s affordability + infrastructure investment provide structural demand (supports developer pricing and absorption).
- Commercial/SEZ tailwind (Million Minds) is a sectoral advantage — adds annuity income and reduces pure-cycle exposure.
- Sector cyclicality and policy/regulatory risks (rezoning, Jantri) create execution/timing risk.
- Competition is rising from national players entering Ahmedabad; however GHCL’s local presence and brand provide an edge.
- Overall attractive but cyclical sector merits a 7/10.

#### Financial Strength: 9/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Debt-to-Equity | 0.14 | <1.5 (Good)
| Interest Coverage | 204x | >2.5x (Good)
| Free Cash Flow (FY25) | ₹193.2 Cr (historic 5‑yr FCF summary)
| Operating Cash Flow (FY25) | ~₹779.3 Cr (FY25 OCF, company disclosures)
| Current Ratio | 6.02 | >1.2 (Good)
| Quick Ratio | 4.27 | >1.0 (Good)
| Net Debt | Net‑debt‑free (cash > nominal borrowings) | Lower is better
| Cash & Equivalents | ₹157 Cr (Mar‑2025) | Higher is better

**Score Reasoning:**
- Net‑debt‑free status for multiple quarters + high OCF (FY25 c. ₹779 Cr) is a major strength — funds CAPEX for SEZ Phase 1 without external debt.
- Very strong interest coverage and low leverage (Debt/Equity 0.14) reduce refinancing risk and provide financial flexibility.
- High ROCE (~44%) and ROE (~37.8%) reflect excellent capital allocation and operating profitability.
- Working‑capital metrics show longer debtor days/CCC (Debtor Days 131; WCD 429) — a watch item (customer receivables / project collection timing) but manageable because company has liquidity and internal funding.
- Overall one of the strongest balance sheets in the mid‑cap developer cohort — 9/10.

#### Valuations: 8/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg | Historical Avg
|-------------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| P/E Ratio | 13.0x | 40.8x (median peer set) | —
| P/B Ratio | 4.09x | 3.29x (median peer set) | —
| EV/EBITDA | 9.67x | 18.16x (median peer set) | —
| Market Cap / Sales | 7.55x (7,504/993.5) | — | —
| PEG Ratio | N/A | — | —
| EV/Sales | ~7.3x | — | —

**Score Reasoning:**
- Valuation is attractive on P/E and EV/EBITDA versus listed developer peers — GHCL trades at a discount despite superior ROE/ROCE and net‑debt‑free status.
- P/B ~4.1 is above some peers but justified by high returns on equity and rapidly improving profitability.
- Intrinsic valuation provided in data ≈ ₹1,764 supports meaningful upside vs CMP.
- Consideration: smaller market cap, geographic concentration, and lower institutional coverage justify not assigning a full premium — hence 8/10.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Key Metrics | Value
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 37.8%
| ROCE | 44.0%
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | ~36%
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | ~29%
| CAPEX (FY25) | ~₹389 Cr (project capex incl. SEZ Phase1 & CWIP)
| CAPEX / Revenue | ~39% (FY25 capex/revenue — indicative)
| Dividend Payout | FY25 payout seen (₹5 final declared); payout ratio ~7% in FY25

**Score Reasoning:**
- Large developable land‑bank (~500 acres; company guidance: ~32–33 Msf pipeline) coupled with strong execution track‑record implies multi‑year growth runway.
- SEZ/commercial projects (Million Minds) provide annuity and diversification – can materially raise recurring revenue share.
- Historic revenue/profit growth and strong return metrics demonstrate high capital efficiency.
- Execution risk and market concentration (Ahmedabad) moderate the score — high upside if execution & leasing go as planned.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Management Quality | Assessment
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | 4 per year (regular investor comms)
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Clear
| Management Communication | High (presentations, detailed concalls)
| Governance Score | 8/10
| Transparency Rating | High

| Corporate Actions | Details
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | ~0.56% (current)
| Dividend History | Sporadic; FY25 final dividend ₹5/share
| Recent Buyback | None
| Capital Allocation Efficiency | Strong (deleveraging + internal funding of SEZ)

**Score Reasoning:**
- Frequent, detailed presentations and concalls; management communicates strategy and pipeline clearly — reflected in quality of investor materials and timely disclosures.
- Appointment of independent directors and name change to Ganesh Housing Limited (Aug 2025) indicates governance evolution.
- Promoter holding high (~73%) — shows founder skin‑in‑the‑game but limits free float; no pledge of promoter shares.
- Overall governance appears robust for a regional developer — 8/10.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Research Metrics | Value
|------------------|-------|
| Average Target Price | ₹1,764 (intrinsic valuation in data)
| Current Price | ₹900
| Upside/Downside | +96% vs intrinsic (indicative)
| Buy Recommendations | Limited public broker coverage (company presentations widely used)
| Hold/ Sell | Limited
| Consensus Rating | Buy (based on presentation + independent analysis)

**Score Reasoning:**
- Broker PDF scraping tool returned limited external broker reports; primary public documentation includes high‑quality company presentations and concall transcripts which analysts rely on.
- Internal intrinsic value (tool output) suggests material upside; lack of broad sell‑side coverage is a limiting factor for institutional flow.
- Research coverage is increasing (more detailed investor presentations) but still thinner than large-cap peers — score 7/10.

| 3 Month | -11.8% (approx) | Underperformed
| 6 Month | -27.1% (approx) | Underperformed
| 1 Year | +3.3% (approx) | In-line/Moderate

| Market Sentiment & Near-term Events | Assessment
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| News Sentiment | Neutral to Positive (project progress & strong results)
| Social Media Buzz | Medium (regional retail interest)
| Options Activity | Neutral
| Upcoming Events | SEZ fit‑outs, One Thaltej approvals, Malabar handovers
| Short‑term Catalysts | Lease signings at Million Minds, project handovers/bookings
| Near‑term Risks | Q1 seasonality, slower bookings if macro softens

**Score Reasoning:**
- Large price runup in late 2024 and early 2025 (peaking ~₹1,480) followed by consolidation; recent price is below 50/200 DMA — near‑term technicals neutral to weak.
- Liquidity is adequate on event days; retail interest and local funds drive flows.
- Technicals don’t negate the fundamental upside but advise staggered entries — score 6/10.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 7/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % | Previous % | Change
|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Promoter Holding | 73.06% | ~73% (2024 onward) | Stable
| FII Holding | 0.47% (Jun‑25) | 0.95% (Mar‑25) | Slight decline
| DII Holding | 0.54% (Jun‑25) | 0.13% (Mar‑25) | Slight increase
| Public Holding | 25.92% | ~26% | Stable
| Pledged Shares | 0.00% | 0.00% | No change

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | Presence of family trusts (NDS/KDS) & some marquee holdings historically
| Recent Changes | Promoter holding stable; FIIs small & variable
| News Sentiment | Neutral
| Options Activity | Neutral

**Score Reasoning:**
- Promoter commitment is high (73%) and unpledged which is positive for long‑term orientation.
- Low FII presence leaves the stock driven by local institutions/retail — contributes to volatility but also to strong conviction moves.
- Increase in shareholder count and entry of quality family trusts (as per filings) is positive.
- Free float is modest; institutional participation remains limited — score 7/10.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | Discount | P/E 13x vs peer median 40.8x; EV/EBITDA 9.7x vs median 18.2x — GHCL trades at a material discount despite higher ROE/ROCE.
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Superior (fundamentals) | ROE 37.8% and ROCE 44% materially outperform peer medians; net‑debt‑free status is superior to many listed developers.

---

## Key Strengths
- Net‑debt‑free balance sheet with strong operating cash flows (FY25 OCF ~₹779.3 Cr) — funds growth without dilutive financing.
- Exceptional profitability: FY25 EBITDA margin ~82% and PAT margin >60% in FY25; ROE ~37.8%, ROCE ~44%.
- Large, low‑cost land bank (~500 acres) and a 32–33 Msf pipeline enabling multi‑year development and optionality.
- Proven execution (projects delivered ahead of schedule) and strategic partnership (Tishman Speyer for Million Minds).
- Zero promoter pledge, consistent deleveraging and demonstrable capital allocation discipline.

## Key Concerns
- Geographic concentration (Ahmedabad heavy exposure) increases city‑specific risk.
- Execution & leasing risks on large commercial/SEZ projects (timing and tenant conversion matter).
- Working capital timing — debtor days and cash conversion cycle lengthened (Debtor Days ~131; WCD ~429) — monitor collections.
- Limited FII coverage and modest sell‑side coverage may amplify volatility and limit liquidity for large institutional trades.
- High reliance on high‑margin project recognitions (accounting timing can swing margins quarter to quarter).

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | FY26 EPS growth ~+30% (FY25 EPS ₹71.72 → FY26 EPS ≈ ₹93.24); valuation multiple re‑rating to P/E 20x (multiple expansion due to demonstrable SEZ leasing, continued net‑debt‑free status, strong ROE).
| **Catalysts** | Faster/stronger leasing at Million Minds (LOIs → binding leases), accelerated project handovers & bookings (Malabar/One Thaltej), sustained margin >75%, favourable macro (rate cuts, improved buyer sentiment).
| **Target Price** | ₹1,865 (EPS ≈ ₹93.24 × P/E 20)
| **Probability** | 20%
| **Justification** | Achieved only if GHCL executes SEZ leasing at or above guidance, bookings accelerate and market awards a premium multiple; feasible but requires multiple positive events converging.

### Base Case Scenario (Most Likely)

| Aspect | Details
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | FY26 EPS growth ~+15% (FY25 EPS ₹71.72 → FY26 EPS ≈ ₹82.48); modest multiple expansion from 13x to 16x as market recognizes net‑debt‑free growth & improving annuity streams.
| **Execution Milestones** | 70–90% occupancy/LOIs convert to leases for SEZ Phase1; steady bookings for Malabar & One Thaltej; continued use of internal accruals for CAPEX.
| **Target Price** | ₹1,320 (EPS ≈ ₹82.48 × P/E 16)
| **Probability** | 60%
| **Justification** | Reasonable — based on current pipeline, company guidance, strong balance sheet and typical market multiple re‑rating for consistent delivery. This is our primary recommendation scenario.

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | FY26 EPS contraction ~‑20% (FY25 EPS ₹71.72 → FY26 EPS ≈ ₹57.38) due to slower bookings, delayed SEZ leasing or prolonged economic softness; multiple compression to P/E 10x.
| **Risk Factors** | Significant execution delays, slower leasing, localized demand slump in Ahmedabad, regulatory or land/approval setbacks.
| **Target Price** | ₹575 (EPS ≈ ₹57.38 × P/E 10)
| **Probability** | 20%
| **Justification** | Downside triggered by a combination of external macro/regulatory shocks and project execution problems; balance sheet cushions but revenue/earnings would be materially impacted.

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bull Case** | +107.2% | ₹1,865 | 20% | +21.44%
| **Base Case** | +46.7% | ₹1,320 | 60% | +28.00%
| **Bear Case** | -36.1% | ₹575 | 20% | -7.22%
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+42.22%**

Probability‑weighted expected return = 0.20×(+107.2%) + 0.60×(+46.7%) + 0.20×(‑36.1%) = **+42.22% over 12 months**

Most Likely Scenario: Base Case — Evidence: Company’s FY25 performance (net‑debt‑free, high margins, FY25 PAT ~₹598 Cr), ongoing SEZ leasing traction with LOIs, large land bank and demonstrated on‑time delivery make the base case the highest probability outcome.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | STRONG BUY
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered Buy / Buy on Dips (2–3 tranche entry)
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹850 - ₹960
| **Stop Loss** | ₹720 (initial stop; use trailing stop on gains)
| **Target Price** | ₹1,320 (12 months) — base case; upside to ₹1,865 (bull)
| **Position Size** | Medium (3–5% of portfolio); increase to Large (5–10%) for high‑conviction investors
| **Timeline** | 12–24 months

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Balance sheet strength (net‑debt‑free), exceptional ROE/ROCE and high cash generation materially lower financial and execution risk — supports higher allocation.
- Large, low‑cost land bank and a diversified pipeline (residential, commercial, SEZ) provide multi‑year earnings visibility and optionality.
- Current valuation (P/E ~13x; EV/EBITDA ~9.7x) is attractive given GHCL’s high profitability — margin of safety present.
- Key execution milestones (SEZ leasing & project handovers) are visible in the next 12 months and act as re‑rating catalysts.
- Use staggered buying to mitigate short‑term seasonality and potential timing risk; maintain stop loss given developer/launch cycle volatility.

## Investment Thesis

1. High‑quality turnaround: From loss‑making (FY20) to a high‑margin, net‑debt‑free developer (FY25), demonstrating execution and capital allocation capabilities.
2. Balance sheet optionality: Net‑debt‑free + strong OCF (FY25) allow GHCL to fund SEZ and other projects internally, reducing financing risk.
3. Large, strategic land bank (~500 acres) + 32–33 Msf pipeline supports multi‑year revenue visibility and optional value unlocks (townships, SEZ, commercial).
4. Earnings mix shift: Move from pure‑development recognition to recurring/annuity income (SEZ leases) improves earnings quality and multiple expansion potential.
5. Valuation gap vs peers: Trades at a meaningful discount to large listed developers despite materially higher ROCE/ROE — offers favorable risk‑reward for patient investors.
