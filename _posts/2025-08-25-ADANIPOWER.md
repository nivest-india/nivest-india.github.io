### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Adani Power (ADANIPOWER) |
| **Sector** | Power Generation |
| **Current Price** | ₹605.65 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹2,33,519 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-25 |

### Industry Overview

- India power demand outlook remains robust: management and presentations cite ~46% increase in electricity demand by FY2032 (implies ~6% CAGR), driven by industrialisation, electrification and digital/EV growth.
- Policy tailwinds for thermal baseload: SHAKTI coal‑allocation revisions and state tenders have created a PPA pipeline and coal allocation opportunities for private IPPs.
- Headwinds from energy transition: renewables growth is rapid but low capacity factor means coal remains important for baseload/firming in the medium term; potential long‑term regulatory / carbon risk persists.
- Fuel security and logistics are key sector differentiators—players with captive mines/rail/port access enjoy material cost advantages and higher IRR on brownfield builds.
- Competitive landscape: a mix of large integrated groups and regional utilities; scale, PPA book and fuel linkage are the decisive moats for private thermal players.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | 6% CAGR (FY25–FY32) |
| Market Size | ₹NA Cr |
| Sector Tailwinds | SHAKTI coal allocations, state PPA tenders, rising peak/base demand |
| Sector Headwinds | Decarbonisation pressure, possible future carbon/regulatory costs |
| Policy Support | Positive for reliable baseload (short‑to‑medium term) |
| Competition Level | Medium/High |
| Technology Disruption | Neutral (renewables growth increases role for baseload providers) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- India’s power demand trajectory (management and industry presentations) supports multi‑year incremental demand for baseload thermal capacity — strong secular tailwind.  
- SHAKTI and state PPA activity materially improve revenue visibility for successful bidders; Adani Power is actively bidding/winning such contracts.  
- Thermal sector faces structural long‑term transition risk (decarbonisation / carbon pricing), but practical grid needs and renewables intermittency support baseload demand in the 3–10 year horizon.  
- Companies with captive mines, logistics, and brownfield execution advantages enjoy a clear cost/turnaround edge — beneficial for Adani Power.  
- Overall sector attractive for disciplined, scale players but requires monitoring of regulatory shifts and emissions policy.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Debt-to-Equity | 0.70 | <1.5 (Good) |
| Interest Coverage | 5.6x | >2.5x (Good) |
| Free Cash Flow | ₹9,957 Cr (FY25 approx FCF) | Positive (Good) |
| Current Ratio | 1.54 | >1.2 (Good) |
| Quick Ratio | 1.34 | >1.0 (Good) |
| Net Debt | ₹33,375 Cr (Borrowings ₹39,495 Cr - Cash ₹6,120 Cr) | Lower is better |
| Cash & Equivalents | ₹6,120 Cr | Higher is better |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong cash generation: operating cash flow FY25 ≈ ₹21,501 Cr and implied FCF ≈ ₹9.9k Cr — supports self‑funded growth narrative.  
- Leverage is moderate: consolidated debt/equity ~0.7 and interest coverage ~5.6x — comfortable debt service capacity.  
- Liquidity cushion: cash ≈ ₹6.1k Cr and access to bank/NCD markets aided by AA/Stable ratings.  
- Net‑debt/EBITDA has ticked up with acquisitions/capex but remains within manageable ranges; careful monitoring advised as the brownfield programme progresses.  
- No immediate distress signals; apply watch on capex drawdowns and potential need for incremental short-term debt if execution timelines slip.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg | Historical Avg |
|-------------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| P/E Ratio | 18.8x | 21.2x (peer median) |  |
| P/B Ratio | 4.15x | 2.62x (peer median) |  |
| EV/EBITDA | 11.4x | 11.23x (peer median) |  |
| Market Cap / Sales | 4.15x | — |  |
| PEG Ratio | 0.5x | — |  |
| EV/Sales | ~4.7x | — |  |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Valuation is a premium on P/B but in line with EV/EBITDA peer median; premium partly justified by superior ROE/ROCE and high PPA coverage.  
- PEG (~0.5) indicates valuation is supported by strong multi‑year EPS growth; however current price already embeds robust growth expectations.  
- Market Cap/Sales looks elevated vs many regulated peers because Adani Power carries a large high‑quality asset base and premium multiple for visibility.  
- Room for multiple expansion exists if execution is crisp and net‑debt falls; downside if EBITDA misses or regulatory headwinds intensify.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 26.1% |
| ROCE | 22.5% |
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | 26.6% |
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | 16.2% |
| CAPEX (FY25) | ₹11,559 Cr (approx fixed assets purchased FY25) |
| CAPEX/Revenue | ~20% (FY25) |
| Dividend Payout | 0.0% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Very large growth runway: management target ~30,670 MW by 2030 (current operational ~17.55 GW; organic pipeline ~12.52 GW locked in) — material volume upside.  
- High historical growth (3‑yr revenue CAGR ~26.6%) with ROE/ROCE in the 20%+ range supports high incremental returns on brownfield expansion.  
- Self‑funded capex claim supported by strong FFO (FY25 FFO ≈ ₹20.5k Cr) but capex intensity is high and execution discipline will determine realised returns.  
- Reliance on brownfield (land/water/BTG pre‑orders) reduces execution risk vs greenfield, but sizeable absolute capex introduces project/permit and timing risks.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | Frequent (multiple concalls + quarterly presentations) |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Clear |
| Management Communication | High |
| Governance Score | 7/10 |
| Transparency Rating | Medium‑High |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | 0.00% |
| Dividend History | Sporadic / low payout historically |
| Recent Buyback | None |
| Capital Allocation Efficiency | Active (acquisitions + brownfield), mixed short term due to capex |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management provides regular concalls, detailed investor presentations and consistent guidance on pipeline and funding — signalling strong communication discipline.  
- Credit rating upgrades (AA/Stable across agencies) and access to capital markets reflect improved financial governance and lender confidence.  
- High promoter holding (~75%) aligns interests but concentrates control; pledge level low (~1.8%) — limited immediate governance red flag.  
- Execution and integration of multiple acquisitions is management’s key operational test; so far turnarounds have shown positive results but remain an ongoing governance/execution watchpoint.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Average Target Price | ₹≈653 (broker blend; samples: ₹680 / ₹669 / ₹610) |
| Current Price | ₹605.65 |
| Upside/Downside | +8% to +19% across reports |
| Buy Recommendations | Majority (Buy / Accumulate) |
| Hold Recommendations | Some (reflecting timing/execution risks) |
| Sell Recommendations | Few |
| Recent Upgrades/Downgrades | Mostly upgrades with improved ratings |
| Consensus Rating | Buy / Accumulate (marginally bullish) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Broker coverage is largely positive; targets cluster in the ₹660–₹680 area (12‑month view), reflecting confidence in the pipeline and cash flows.  
- Research houses assume robust EBITDA expansion over FY26–FY28 and assign EV/EBITDA multiples in the 10–12x range — consistent with assigned targets.  
- Analysts flag execution, merchant tariff cycles and fuel/regulatory risks as key contingencies.

| 1 Month | +1.8% (approx) | — |
| 3 Month | +6–8% (approx) | — |
| 6 Month | +3–6% (approx) | — |
| 1 Year | -10% (one‑year prior lows to recovery) | — |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| RSI | N/A |
| 50‑DMA | ₹582.57 |
| 200‑DMA | ₹562.86 |
| Volume Trend | Mixed; periodic spikes at corporate events |

| Market Sentiment & Near-term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------|

| Social Media Buzz | Medium |
| Options Activity | Neutral |
| Upcoming Events | FY26 PPA auctions, Q2 demand data, project execution updates |
| Short-term Catalysts | New PPA awards, milestone completions, receivable inflows from Bangladesh |
| Near-term Risks | Merchant tariff softness (seasonal/monsoon), execution slippage |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is above both 50‑DMA and 200‑DMA (positive technical bias), recent recovery after volatility and news such as stock split and acquisition approvals.  
- Volume spikes around corporate announcements indicate investor interest; overall sentiment improved with rating upgrades and PPA wins.  
- No immediate technical over‑extension but monitor demand seasonality and merchant price cycles for short‑term volatility.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 7/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % | Previous % | Change |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Promoter Holding | 74.96% | ~74–72% (recent quarters) | +/‑ small |
| FII Holding | 12.46% | 12–17% | Stable |
| DII Holding | 1.76% | 1–1.6% | Slight ↑ |
| Public Holding | 10.82% | 11–13% | Slight ↓ |
| Pledged Shares | 1.81% | ~2% | Low |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|

| Recent Changes | Incremental FII rotation; promoter consolidation earlier but stable recently |
| News Sentiment | Neutral/Positive |
| Social Media Buzz | Medium |
| Options Activity | Neutral |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High promoter stake indicates strong founder control and alignment but lower free float; pledging low.  
- Institutional ownership meaningful and includes reputed global funds — positive for corporate governance oversight and liquidity.  
- No major promoter dilution; watch any future incremental acquisitions that could alter capital structure.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | In-line to Slight Premium | EV/EBITDA ~11.4x roughly in-line with peer median ~11.2x; P/B is a premium due to strong ROE and asset quality |
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Superior | Higher ROE/ROCE, stronger FCF and a larger locked‑in PPA pipeline than many peers; better execution metrics (PLF & availability) |

## Key Strengths
- Market leader in private thermal generation with scale and a large locked‑in pipeline (17.55 GW operating; 12.52 GW organic pipeline).  
- Strong cash generation (FFO ~₹20.5k Cr FY25) and positive free cash flow supporting self‑funded capex.  
- Fuel‑security and logistics integration (captive mines, port/rail linkages) reduce operating cost volatility.  
- Improved credit profile (AA/Stable ratings) and moderate leverage increase financial flexibility.  
- High operational metrics (PLF ~71%, availability ~91%) and demonstrated turnaround capability for acquired assets.

## Key Concerns  
- Large ongoing capex and acquisitions — execution/timing risk; slippages would pressure cash flows and leverage.  
- Merchant tariff cyclicality and weather‑driven demand seasonality can compress short‑term margins.  
- Regulatory / policy shifts on emissions or coal allocation remain a medium‑term risk.  
- High promoter concentration reduces free float and may amplify volatility.  
- Low dividend payout (management retains cash for growth) — less income focus for yield investors.

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | FY27E consolidated EBITDA rises to ~₹30,000 Cr (rapid PPA conversion, higher merchant/contract mix), net debt reduced to ~₹33,000 Cr, EV/EBITDA multiple expands to 12.0x due to de‑risking and multiple expansion. |
| **Catalysts** | Faster PPA wins (UP/Bihar/MP tenders), early commissioning of brownfield units, steady/low coal prices, receivables regularisation (Bangladesh & state DISCOMs), positive rating momentum. |
| **Target Price** | ₹850 (12 months) — derived: EV = 30,000 × 12.0 = ₹3,60,000 Cr; Equity = EV − Net Debt (₹33,000 Cr) = ₹3,27,000 Cr; Shares outstanding ≈ 385.66 Cr => Price ≈ ₹850. |
| **Probability** | 25% |
| **Justification** | High but achievable if execution stays on schedule, merchant rates recover and PPA pipeline converts; strong operational metrics and BTG orders support this path. |

### Base Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | FY27E consolidated EBITDA ~₹27,000 Cr (moderate growth from FY25), net debt ~₹40,280 Cr (acquisition + capex), EV/EBITDA ~11.2x (broker consensus). |
| **Execution Milestones** | Normal progress on brownfield projects, PPA conversions consistent with management guidance, stable coal logistics. |
| **Target Price** | ₹680 (12 months) — broker‑aligned consensus target. Calculation: EV = 27,024 × 11.2 = ₹3,02,669 Cr; Equity = EV − Net Debt (₹40,280 Cr) = ₹2,62,389 Cr; Price ≈ ₹680. |
| **Probability** | 60% |
| **Justification** | This mirrors broker median expectations (Asit C. Mehta, ICICI etc.) and management guidance: realistic PPA conversion and moderate margin expansion; current rating/credit access supports this view. |

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | EBITDA falls / underperforms to ~₹20,000 Cr (project delays, weaker merchant tariffs), net debt rises to ₹45,000 Cr (capex drawdowns), EV/EBITDA compresses to 9.0x on market de‑rating. |
| **Risk Factors** | Execution delays, adverse coal/regulatory shock, large DISCOM payment issues, slower Bangladesh receipts, rising interest rates. |
| **Target Price** | ₹350 (12 months) — Calculation: EV = 20,000 × 9 = ₹1,80,000 Cr; Equity = EV − Net Debt (₹45,000 Cr) = ₹1,35,000 Cr; Price ≈ ₹350. |
| **Probability** | 15% |
| **Justification** | Material execution / demand shocks could reprice the stock sharply lower despite underlying asset base; tail risk while low‑probability is significant in magnitude. |

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bull Case** | +40.35% | ₹850 | 25% | +10.09% |
| **Base Case** | +12.28% | ₹680 | 60% | +7.37% |
| **Bear Case** | -42.24% | ₹350 | 15% | -6.34% |
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+11.12%** |

Probability‑weighted expected return = 25% × (+40.35%) + 60% × (+12.28%) + 15% × (‑42.24%) = **+11.12% over 12 months**

Most Likely Scenario: Base Case — Evidence: Broker consensus targets (₹660–₹680), management guidance and FY25 cash‑flow and credit metrics support moderate near‑term growth; portfolio of PPAs and secured BTG orders. Base case is assigned the highest probability because it aligns with current observable contract wins, cash generation, and rating stability.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | HOLD |
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered accumulation / Buy on dips (targeted accumulation if price falls below ₹540) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹520 - ₹620 |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹480 (tactical for short‑term traders) |
| **Target Price** | ₹680 (12 months) |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2–5% portfolio) |
| **Timeline** | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Risk‑adjusted expected return (~11.1%) is attractive for a core allocation but below a high‑conviction buy threshold (≥15%); hence HOLD is the calibrated stance.  
- Strong fundamentals (scale, FCF, PPA pipeline, AA/Stable ratings) provide a margin of safety, but execution/capex timing risks and merchant tariff cyclicality limit near‑term upside.  
- Use staged buying on meaningful dips (toward ₹520–₹560) given the potential for volatility from project execution or demand cycles.  
- Monitor near‑term catalysts — PPA awards, brownfield commissioning updates, FY26 quarterly demand trends and receivable collections (Bangladesh & DISCOMs).  
- For yield/income investors the low dividend policy is a constraint; for growth investors the long runway (30.67 GW target) remains an attractive structural story on disciplined terms.

## Investment Thesis
- Adani Power is a high‑quality baseload platform with best‑in‑class plant availability (≈91%) and PLF (~71%), delivering strong cash flow and ROE/ROCE >20%.  
- The company’s fuel‑logistics, captive mine strategy and BTG pre‑orders materially lower execution and operating risk relative to peers.  
- Balance sheet and credit improvements (AA/Stable ratings) enable lower cost of capital for large brownfield expansions; capex largely self‑funded in management’s plan.  
- Main risks are project execution timing, merchant tariff cyclicality and potential regulatory shifts on coal/emissions; these risks are real but manageable given the company’s integrated position.  
- Recommended approach: maintain exposure (HOLD), accumulate tactically on dips while tracking project milestones and PPA awards.
