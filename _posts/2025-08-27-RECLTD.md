### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | REC Limited (RECLTD) |
| **Sector** | Financials - Infrastructure Finance |
| **Current Price** | ₹364 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹95,731 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-27 |

### Industry Overview
- India power & infra financing remains a structurally attractive market driven by distribution upgrades, renewable energy additions and large public capex programmes; government schemes (e.g., rural electrification, DISCOM modernization) support steady flow of lending opportunities for REC.  
- Policy/regulatory tailwinds (state support, nodal role in government schemes) reduce counterparty uncertainty vs. purely private borrowers, but DISCOM financial stress remains a recurring sector-level risk.  
- The renewable energy capex cycle and transmission upgrades are medium-term growth drivers; private and PPP infra lending (roads, ports, metros) provide diversification.  
- Interest rate environment and wholesale bond markets materially affect cost of funds and margins for infra financiers: continued access to low-cost bond/foreign borrowing is a competitive advantage.  
- Competitive landscape: large PSU financiers (Power Finance Corp, IRFC, HUDCO) dominate; pricing and borrowing access are key differentiators.

## Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| REC FY23 Sanctions | ₹2,68,460 Cr |
| Disbursement goal FY24 (management guidance) | ~₹1,50,000 Cr |
| Loan book mix (H1 FY24) | State 90% / Private 10% |
| Loan exposure by segment (H1 FY24) | Generation 29% / Distribution 44% / Transmission 10% / Renewables 6% / Infra & Logistics 10% |
| Sovereign / Government linkage | Nodal agency for central schemes (DDUGJY, Saubhagya) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Large, structural addressable market — India’s power sector modernization and renewables rollout give sustainable long-term demand for REC’s lending; government schemes create reliable project pipelines.  
- High share of state/municipal counterparties (majority state exposures) reduces outright commercial default risk but ties performance to state finances and political/regulatory outcomes.  
- Diversification into infra & logistics (roads, ports, metros) is positive — reduces concentrated sector risk tied only to power distribution.  
- Sector-level risks remain: DISCOM financial health and tariff/regulatory reforms can materially affect collections and asset quality.  
- Funding environment (bond markets, foreign borrowing, green bonds) is a sector advantage for REC given sovereign perceived support and its access to low-cost funds.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TTM Net Profit | ₹16,890 Cr |
| ROE | 21.5% |
| Debt / Equity | 6.33 |
| Borrowings (Mar 2025) | ₹496,243 Cr |
| Interest Coverage | 1.61 |
| Quick Ratio | 1.13 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong profitability metrics for a financier: ROE ~21.5% and sustained PAT growth (5-year profit CAGR ~26%), indicating high capital efficiency.  
- Large and growing borrowing book (borrowings up materially from FY23 → FY25) is normal for a financing NBFC but increases leverage and interest-rate sensitivity; nonetheless REC’s access to diversified funding (bonds / FC loans / tax-free instruments) is a strength.  
- Interest coverage ~1.6 is modest — reflects the nature of lending business (net interest margin vs interest on borrowings) but means rising funding costs can compress PAT.  
- Liquidity position & comfortable quick ratio (~1.13) and ability to tap tax-free/54EC/green bonds provide funding flexibility and mitigate rollover risks.  
- Asset quality historically acceptable (management reported gross NPA ~3.4% & net NPA ~1.0% in earlier disclosures) and a dedicated stressed-assets team — monitor for any deterioration related to DISCOM stress or large infra projects.

#### Valuations: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price / EPS (P/E) | 5.7x |
| Price / Book (P/B) | 1.22x |
| EV / EBITDA | 10.4x |
| Dividend Yield | 4.95% |
| Consensus / Median PE (historic median) | ~4.4x (median reference) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Valuation is inexpensive on absolute terms (P/E ~5.7) and yields ~5% — attractive for conservative income + value investors.  
- P/B ~1.2x with strong ROE (~21%) implies business earns attractive returns on equity; potential for re-rating if earnings sustain.  
- EV/EBITDA in line with large PSU financier peers (PFC similar), indicating fair pricing versus sector.  
- Relative valuation vs peers: REC trades near PFC on P/E but below many private infra financiers — room for re-rating if asset quality and return metrics remain stable.  
- Risk: low market multiple reflects perceived sector/funding risks; valuation is therefore a buffer but could compress further under adverse macro/asset-quality shocks.

#### Growth Potential: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sales Growth (5Y CAGR) | ~13.5% |
| Profit Growth (5Y CAGR) | ~26.1% |
| Management disbursement targets (FY24 guidance) | Sanctions ~₹4,00,000 Cr; Disbursements ~₹1,50,000 Cr (ambitious) |
| Loan book diversification | Infra & Logistics increasing share |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Medium-term growth runway remains healthy driven by distribution system upgrades, renewables and transmission projects; management targets are ambitious and achievable if execution/funding align.  
- Historical earnings CAGR strong — REC has demonstrated the ability to scale PAT while maintaining ROE.  
- Growth constrained by sovereign/regulatory cycles and state DISCOM balance sheets — large-ticket projects may be slow to monetize or restructure.  
- Diversification into infra & logistics (non-power) provides incremental growth levers and less correlation with DISCOM performance.  
- Execution risk exists (funding cost management, NPA resolution) — growth without margin compression depends on continued access to low-cost funding.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter | Power Finance Corporation Ltd (52.63%) |
| Dividend Policy | Payout ~29.8% (consistent) |
| Pledged shares | 0.00% |
| Promoter stability | Stable PSU promoter (PFC) since 2019 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Majority promoter is Power Finance Corporation (PFC) — a large PSU promoter which increases oversight, access to resources and perceived sovereign support.  
- Consistent dividend payout (~30%) and regular distributions demonstrate shareholder-friendly returns; no share pledging reported.  
- As a PSU-backed entity, governance standards and transparency are generally robust, but decisions can be influenced by policy priorities.  
- No material governance red flags in the reviewed filings/data; monitoring needed for related-party and state-linked exposures.  
- Management communication on asset quality & disbursement targets has been clear, but continued transparency on stressed-asset resolution is important.

#### Research Reports: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Research coverage | Moderate (domestic & select global brokers) |
| Broker targets / notes analysed | No additional external broker PDFs analysed for this report |

**Score Reasoning:**
- REC is covered by major domestic brokers — coverage exists but depth of independent research on stressed assets varies across brokers.  
- We did not analyse external research PDFs as part of this report (no broker PDFs were processed) — hence limited direct report-level thesis inclusion.  
- Available consensus from market data suggests value-oriented calls, reflecting low multiples and stable yields; analyst targets historically vary given funding/asset-quality sensitivity.  
- For full broker-thesis integration, targeted broker reports (latest quarterly notes) should be reviewed; absence reduces weight given to broker-driven catalysts.  
- Recommend investors review recent broker notes (12-month targets, assumptions on NIM/funding costs) before large allocations.

#### Technical Analysis: 4/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | ₹363.6 (chart reference) |
| 50 DMA | ~₹392.6 |
| 200 DMA | ~₹435.3 |
| RSI (14) | 28.4 (oversold) |
| Momentum Score (Trendlyne) | 33.0 (technically weak) |
| Key supports / resistances | Support: ₹358 / ₹353 / ₹345 | Resistance (pivot): ₹367 / ₹380 / ₹405 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is below all major SMAs (5/10/20/50/100/200) → clear medium-term downtrend / underperformance.  
- Oscillators show oversold conditions (RSI ~28, MFI ~26) indicating potential for short-term bounce but not confirmed trend reversal.  
- Volume spikes during earlier rallies (mid-2024) indicate episodic buying; recent volumes moderate.  
- Technical risk-reward is asymmetric: oversold readings can produce mean-reversion trades but failure to reclaim 50/200 DMA will keep bearish bias.  
- Traders should wait for confirmation (price > 50 DMA and improvement in momentum) for conviction; long-term investors will prioritize fundamentals.

#### Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 52-week high / low | ₹636 / ₹357 |
| 1-year price change | ~-38% (from peak) |
| FII holding (Jun 2025) | ~19.2% |
| DII holding (Jun 2025) | ~15.5% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent price action shows erosion from 52-week highs (significant drawdown) — market sentiment turned cautious since mid-2024.  
- Institutional flows show stable promoter holding with FIIs rotating but still meaningful (~19%); DIIs have increased participation (supportive).  
- Dividend yield and stable earnings attract income-focused investors; negative market sentiment driven mainly by macro and rate concerns rather than company-specific governance issues.  
- News flow around power sector reforms or large state-level defaults could swing sentiment sharply; monitor DISCOM reforms for sentiment catalysts.  
- Short-term sentiment is neutral-to-negative; medium-term could improve if funding costs fall and asset-quality remains stable.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter Holding (Power Fin. Corp.) | 52.63% |
| FII (Jun 2025) | 19.16% |
| DII (Jun 2025) | 15.51% |
| Public / Others | ~12.65% |
| Pledge | 0.00% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong, stable promoter holding (PFC) provides strategic support and credibility; no promoter dilution or selling pressure visible.  
- Meaningful FII participation (~19-21% historically) indicates international investor interest while DIIs are increasing exposure — healthy institutional mix.  
- No share pledging and consistent dividend payouts are positive governance signals.  
- Public float moderate (12-14%) — liquidity is adequate but large block moves by institutions can influence price.  
- No marquee retail value-accumulator names (e.g., well-known private investors) are dominant; investor base is institutional-heavy which supports stability.

| HUDCO | ₹41,616 Cr | 15.0x | 2.32x | 15.7% | 13.4x |

(Values rounded; peer metrics from consolidated market/financial data.)

## Key Strengths
- Strong ROE (~21%) and consistent profit growth (5-year PAT CAGR ~26%).  
- Government/PSU promoter (PFC) support and nodal role in central schemes — favourable for funding and access.  
- Attractive yield + low absolute valuation (P/E ~5.7, dividend yield ~5%) — compelling for value/income investors.  
- Diversified lending book across generation, distribution, transmission and infra/logistics; active green bond and foreign fundraising track record.  
- Conservative shareholder-return behaviour (consistent dividend payout ~30%) and no promoter pledging.

## Key Concerns  
- High leverage (borrowings ~₹496k Cr) — business model is interest-rate sensitive; higher funding costs can compress spreads and PAT.  
- Dependency on state-owned DISCOMs — underlying counterparty & regulatory risk persists.  
- Interest coverage (~1.6) leaves limited buffer for rising interest expense or margin pressure.  
- Market sentiment has turned negative (large drawdown from 52W high) meaning short-term volatility risk.  
- Cash flow from operations negative in periods due to aggressive disbursements — requires continuous funding access.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹650 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Rapid earnings growth (earnings recovery + expansion in disbursements), NIM stability/re-expansion, and multiple expansion as investor confidence returns (P/E re-rating to ~10x on TTM EPS), plus continued access to low-cost bond/foreign funding and visible resolution of stressed large accounts.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹450 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Stable execution, TTM EPS (64.1) growing modestly (~5-10%) with disbursements and steady spreads; moderate multiple expansion to ~7x driven by steady PAT, consistent dividend (~5% yield) and sector tailwinds. Assumes asset quality remains stable and funding markets remain accessible.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹260 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Adverse surprise in asset quality (DISCOM deterioration or larger stressed accounts), rise in borrowing costs compresses margins and earnings; multiple compression (P/E falls to ~4x) and yield-seeking selling pressure; liquidity/funding strains and negative market sentiment.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP (₹364) | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|----------------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹650 | +79% | Upside from re-rating & execution — high reward but contingent on improvement in margins and asset-quality resolution |
| Realistic | ₹450 | +24% | Balanced outcome — stable earnings and modest multiple expansion; meets BUY threshold (≥15% upside) |
| Pessimistic | ₹260 | -29% | Negative outcome driven by funding/asset-quality stresses — significant downside risk |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (based on realistic scenario showing ~24% upside vs CMP)  
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Upside (~24% realistic) outweighs downside (~29% stressed), combined with attractive dividend yield and low absolute valuation. Investors should be comfortable with sector-specific funding / asset-quality risks.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target (Realistic) | Position Size | Time Horizon |
|----------------|----------|-------------------:|----------:|--------------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| BUY | Core / Income + modest growth | ₹350 - ₹380 | ₹320 (≈ -12% from CMP) | ₹450 (12 months) | Medium (2-5% portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- REC offers a defensive-quality infra-finance franchise with attractive current yield (~5%) and low absolute valuation. Realistic re-rating potential and stable ROE support a BUY call for medium-term investors. Entry near current levels (₹350–380) gives a reasonable margin of safety; use stop-loss to manage downside given sector funding sensitivity.

## Investment Thesis
1. REC is a government-linked infra financier with a dominant position in power-sector lending; stable promoter backing (PFC) and nodal role in central schemes provide structural advantages and funding access.  
2. Financial profile is robust: high ROE (~21%), strong PAT growth historically and attractive dividend yield make REC attractive for income + value portfolios.  
3. Valuation is inexpensive (P/E ~5.7, P/B ~1.22) relative to growth/ROE profile — potential for multiple expansion if asset-quality remains stable and funding cost moderates.  
4. Key risks are funding-cost volatility and DISCOM/large-project credit stress; these are monitored through interest coverage, incremental NPA metrics and state-level reform progress.  
5. Trade-off: attractive risk-adjusted return at current prices for investors who accept sector-specific risks — recommended BUY for medium-term allocation with defined stop-loss and position sizing.
