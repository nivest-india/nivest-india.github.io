### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Aptus Value Housing Finance India Ltd (APTUS) |
| **Sector** | Housing Finance (NBFC / HFC — affordable housing & small business loans) |
| **Current Price** | ₹336 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹16,817 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-27 |

### Industry Overview

- Affordable / small-ticket housing finance in India remains under‑penetrated outside large cities; strong structural demand from first‑time homebuyers in Tier‑2/3/4 markets supports multi‑year growth for focused AHFCs/HFCs.
- NBFC / HFC lenders that combine branch reach with digital sourcing show scalability advantages (lower cost-to-acquire, faster TAT); Aptus’ mobile-first LOS is aligned with this model.
- Funding dynamics and cost of funds are a key industry lever — rating upgrades and diversified wholesale funding materially reduce incremental borrowing cost.
- Competitive intensity is increasing (banks, SFBs, larger NBFCs and fintechs targeting micro/affordable segments), raising execution and deposit/funding risks for mid-sized players.
- Regulatory clarity for HFCs and SARFAESI access (for recoveries) are positive for secured‑loans players but require continued vigilance on collections & provisioning.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Peer median P/E | 20.19 |
| Peer median PBV (CMP/BV) | 1.92 |
| Median ROE (peer set) | 14.25% |
| Aptus 5‑yr AUM CAGR | ~28–29% |
| Market segment | Affordable / LIG / self‑employed customers; large under‑penetrated market |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong structural tailwind: affordable-housing and first‑time homebuyer demand in semi‑urban India creates a long runway — Aptus targets this large addressable market and has shown sustained AUM growth (5‑yr CAGR ~28%).
- Favorable competitive niche: focused, contiguous expansion and local underwriting are defensible versus broader lenders; digital LOS amplifies scale.
- Funding & rate sensitivity: industry margins depend on borrowing costs; Aptus benefits from rating upgrades and diversified borrowing but remains sensitive to macro rates — a sectoral risk.
- Regulatory clarity improved (HFCs benefit from SARFAESI for recoveries) but evolving rules (RBI/NHB) require robust compliance and process discipline.
- Conclusion: sector fundamentals strong for focused AHFCs; execution, branch productivity and funding are the main sector risks.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Net worth (Mar 2025) | ₹4,317 Cr |
| Borrowings (Mar 2025) | ₹6,873 Cr |
| Debt / Equity | 1.59x |
| Liquidity (cash + undrawn bank sanctions, Q1 FY26) | ~₹1,532 Cr |
| Capital adequacy (CRAR) | ~70% (Q1 FY26) |
| GNPA / NNPA (FY25) | 1.19% / 0.89% |
| NIM (FY25) | 12.96% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong capital buffer: net worth ~₹4,317 Cr and CRAR ~70% provide ample headroom for growth and absorb shocks; management intends leverage caps (target ~4–5x when needed).
- Healthy liquidity: on‑balance cash + undrawn bank sanctions reported around ₹1,500–1,540 Cr (Q1 FY26), supporting disbursement cadence and near‑term ALM.
- High profitability & margins: NIM near 13%, ROA ~7.7% and ROE ~18.6% (FY25) demonstrate efficient earnings generation relative to book size.
- Leverage rising but manageable: borrowings grew (FY25 borrowings ~₹6,873 Cr); Debt/Equity ~1.59x is moderate but requires monitoring as book scales.
- Asset-quality caveat: GNPA ticked up to ~1.19% (FY25) and provision coverage (PCR) is low (~25% on Stage‑3) — an area to watch; credit cost guidance remains moderate (~40–50 bps).

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current P/E (TTM) | ~21.0 |
| P/BV (CMP / BV) | 3.89x |
| Book value (per share, latest) | ~₹86.4 |
| EV / EBITDA | ~14.25 |
| Intrinsic value (tool estimate) | ₹320 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Premium vs peers on PBV: Aptus trades at ~3.9x PBV vs peer median ~1.9x — market prices a premium for superior ROE and NIM, but PBV is materially above the peer median.
- P/E roughly in line with peer median P/E (~20) — current P/E ~21 reflects expectations of continued high earnings growth.
- Quality justification: high ROE (~18.5%) and industry‑leading NIM support a premium multiple, but valuation leaves limited margin for adverse execution or asset‑quality shocks.
- Intrinsic/quant models in available research point to fair value in the low‑to‑mid ₹300s → current price is modestly above some intrinsic estimates.
- Conclusion: valuations reflect high growth & profitability but offer less cushion; patient investors need confidence in execution and asset quality.

#### Growth Potential: 9/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM (FY25) | ₹10,865 Cr |
| 5‑yr AUM CAGR | ~28–29% |
| Management AUM target | ₹25,000 Cr by FY28–29 |
| Disbursement guidance (FY26) | ~22–25% growth (management) |
| Branch expansion | ~35–40 new branches p.a. (guidance) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Proven track record: consistent AUM and PAT CAGR (~28–29% sales/profits growth) over recent years demonstrates repeatable growth capability.
- Management targets are ambitious but credible: pathway to ₹25,000 Cr AUM (FY28/29) anchored on branch + digital scaling, which matches historical execution.
- Diversification and higher yield products: small business loans / quasi‑home loans broaden yields and reduce single-product concentration while improving NII.
- Digital & productivity levers: mobile-first LOS and referral/digital channels (20%+ of originations) lower incremental costs and speed scaling.
- Execution risks remain (new state rollouts, branch productivity & field attrition) but net growth potential is high given capital & liquidity availability.

#### Corporate Governance: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding (Jun 2025) | 40.37% |
| Notable investors | WestBridge (16.19% Jun 2025), Smallcap World, Malabar, Steadview, Govt Pension Fund Global |
| Promoter pledge reported | ~47.6% (reported metric — monitor for details) |
| ESOP activity | Multiple allotments 2023–2025 (active ESOP program) |
| Dividend policy | Payout ~29.9% (FY25), consistent interim payouts in FY24–25 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Experienced & stable management with clear in‑house control over sourcing, underwriting, valuation and collections — this is a governance plus for a retail lender.
- Institutional investor base is strong (FIIs and well‑known funds), which supports transparency and board oversight.
- Concerning signals: significant promoter stake churn (WestBridge reduced stake) and a reportedly high pledged percentage (~47.6%) are corporate governance flags—require monitoring and clarification on pledge details.
- Active ESOP issuances are positive for retention but create dilution/complexity and must be managed transparently.
- Overall: governance has strong operational discipline and investor engagement, but promoter pledge and ownership changes are meaningful risks.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Broker | Date | Recommendation | Target Price |
|--------|------|----------------|--------------|
| ICICI Securities | 02 Aug 2025 | BUY | ₹400 |
| ICICI Securities | 04 Aug 2024 | BUY | ₹400 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent broker coverage (ICICI Securities) is constructive — both reports maintain BUY with a ₹400 target, basing valuation on 3.5–4.3x forward BV or mid‑teens forward P/E tied to earnings growth.
- Analysts’ thesis: high ROE, industry‑leading NIM, disciplined cost structure and credible AUM guidance justify a premium.
- Key report caveats: GNPA upticks, execution in new states, and funding dynamics are repeatedly flagged as downside risks.
- Coverage breadth: institutional coverage exists but is not as wide as large-cap banks/HFCs; as franchise scales, analyst coverage and liquidity should improve.
- Overall: analyst consensus supports our realistic target (₹400) — align with broker methodologies (BV‑multiple / forward EPS).

#### Technical Analysis: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current price (latest) | ₹336.10 |
| 50‑DMA | ~₹339 |
| 200‑DMA | ~₹326 |
| RSI (14) | 44.3 (neutral) |
| 1‑yr price change | +~7.7% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Mixed to neutral technical picture: price is slightly below the 50‑DMA but comfortably above the 200‑DMA — short‑term weakness amidst longer‑term uptrend.
- Oscillators neutral to mildly negative (RSI mid‑range, Stochastic low) — indicates limited immediate momentum and potential for consolidation.
- Trading volumes show intermittent spikes around corporate events — liquidity is adequate but episodic.
- Key technical supports: ~₹332–328 (near S1/S2 pivot) and stronger support ~₹323; resistance cluster ~₹340–350.
- Conclusion: technicals suggest a neutral view — use fundamentals for longer‑term allocation, technicals for tactical entries.

#### Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Event / Signal | Market Implication |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Q1 FY26 concall (Aug 2025): rating upgrade, NIM/ROE beat | Positive — reduces CoF and supports margins |
| WestBridge stake reduction (Jun 2025) | Negative sentiment on promoter/institutional changes |
| Interim dividends & NCD issuances (May 2025) | Positive — shareholder returns + funding diversification |
| Media / price action (short term) | Neutral to slightly bearish (short‑term consolidation) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management commentary (recent concalls) is constructive — rating upgrade and guidance on lower cost of funds are sentiment positives.
- Corporate actions such as dividend and large NCD approval are supportive for investor confidence and ALM.
- Promoter / institutional stake changes and high reported pledge percent are negatives that have dented sentiment at times.
- Overall sentiment is cautious‑positive among fundamental investors, mixed among traders (short‑term consolidation).

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Category (Jun 2025) | Share (%) |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Promoters | 40.37% |
| FIIs | 30.41% |
| DIIs | 16.04% |
| Public / Others | 13.19% |
| Notable FIIs / funds | Smallcap World, Malabar, Steadview, Govt Pension Fund Global |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Institutional ownership is meaningful and rising (FIIs ~30% in latest period) — provides governance oversight and liquidity.
- Promoter ownership has fallen from previous levels (earlier >50%) — significant reduction largely due to large fund share movements (WestBridge etc.).
- Reported promoter pledge (~47.6%) is a governance red flag and requires active monitoring (may be partly linked to founder financing or structured arrangements).
- Public float remains modest relative to market cap; increases in FII/DII participation are positive for valuation discovery.
- Conclusion: high institutional interest is offset by promoter pledge and stake dilution — watch next major filings for pledge / re‑structuring detail.

|------|---------------------|-----:|---------:|------:|------------:|----------:|
| Bajaj Housing | 93,597 | 41.35 | 4.69 | 13.46% | 19.24 | 4.11 |
| LIC Housing | 30,826 | 5.60 | 0.85 | 16.05% | 11.17 | 7.45 |

| PNB Housing | 20,391 | 9.99 | 1.21 | 12.27% | 10.75 | 3.70 |
| Aptus Value Housing | 16,817 | 21.05 | 3.89 | 18.58% | 14.25 | 1.59 |
| Home First Financial | 13,368 | 32.35 | 4.62 | 16.46% | 16.65 | 3.79 |
| Aavas Financiers | 12,447 | 21.19 | 2.85 | 14.11% | 13.54 | 3.19 |
| Median (selected peer set) | 9,851 | 20.19 | 1.92 | 14.25% | 12.23 | 3.22 |

- Aptus is positioned with one of the higher ROEs and competitive EV/EBITDA among mid‑cap AHFCs, but trades at a PBV premium vs median (reflecting premium for ROE and growth).

## Key Strengths
- High and durable NIM (~13%) and industry‑leading ROE (~18.5%) — strong profitability per unit of assets.
- Proven high growth track record (AUM & PAT CAGR ~28–29% over recent years) with clear AUM expansion plan (₹25,000 Cr target).
- Strong capital position and liquidity (CRAR ~70%; surplus cash + undrawn bank limits ~₹1.5k Cr), enabling growth without immediate dilution.
- In‑house end‑to‑end operations (sourcing, underwriting, valuation, collections) combined with digital LOS for scalability and control.
- Diversified funding program (banks, NHB, NCDs, securitisation) and recent rating upgrades — support lower incremental funding cost.

## Key Concerns  
- Asset quality & provisions: GNPA uptick (~1.19%) and low Stage‑3 PCR (~25%) mean earnings can be volatile if delinquencies widen.
- Corporate governance risks: promoter stake movement and a reportedly high pledged percentage (~47.6%) are governance / financial structure concerns.
- Valuation premium: PBV materially above peer median — limited margin of safety if growth/earning assumptions slip.
- Execution risk in new geographies: scaling into Maharashtra and Odisha requires strong local execution (hiring, collections) to maintain asset quality.
- Dependence on wholesale funding markets — any abrupt tightening could pressure marginal cost-of-funds, despite long-tenor borrowings.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹480 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Rapid execution on branch roll‑out and productivity (AUM accelerates to/above management target trajectory), sustained NIM (~13%) and RoE >20%, rating upgrade benefits fully scale (cost of funds drop 40–60 bps), market grants multiple expansion (P/E ~22–24 or PBV 4.5–5x on higher BV). Strong macro and benign credit cycle.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹400 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management delivers guidance (AUM growth ~24–28% FY26), NIM holds near 12.5–13%, credit cost stays within 35–45 bps, profitability and capital metrics remain solid. Valuation aligns with broker consensus (ICICI) using ~4x forward BV or mid/high‑teens forward P/E.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹270 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Slower growth or execution issues in new states, credit slippage increases (GNPA/Stage‑3 rise materially), PCR remains low necessitating higher provisions or earnings cut; market compresses multiples (P/E falls into low teens / PBV falls to ~2x) due to sector or company‑specific stress.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|--------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹480 | +43% | Strong execution + multiple re-rate; high upside for high‑conviction investors |
| Realistic | ₹400 | +19% | Most likely outcome given guidance, justifies BUY (≥15% upside) |
| Pessimistic | ₹270 | -20% | Significant downside on credit/multiple compression — risk case for stop‑loss / trimming |

Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:
- Primary Recommendation: BUY (based on Realistic scenario showing ~19% upside vs current price).  
- Risk‑Reward Assessment: Reward (~+19% base, to +43% in optimistic) outweighs downside (~‑20% in adverse case) given strong profitability, capital, and clear growth levers — but monitor asset quality, promoter pledge disclosures, and funding costs closely.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price | Position Size | Timeframe |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------:|----------:|-------------:|--------------:|----------:|
| BUY | Core / Long‑term growth (accumulate on dips) | ₹320 — ₹350 | ₹275 | ₹400 (primary realistic target) | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Aptus combines high NIM, industry‑leading ROE, strong capital and liquidity, and a demonstrated ability to scale in under‑penetrated markets. The company’s digital platform and in‑house processes support disciplined underwriting even as the book grows. Given management guidance and broker valuations, a 12‑month realistic target of ₹400 implies a favorable reward/risk (>15% upside). Investors should size positions based on risk appetite and monitor GNPA/provisioning, promoter pledge disclosures, and execution in new states.

## Investment Thesis
1. Durable profitability: NIM ~13% and ROE ~18–19% create high operating leverage that supports free cash generation as AUM scales.
2. High growth runway: historical AUM CAGR ~28% and management target to reach ₹25,000 Cr AUM by FY28/29 make sustained earnings growth plausible.
3. Capital & liquidity strength: CRAR ~70% and substantial cash + undrawn sanctions (~₹1.5k Cr) limit near‑term refinancing risk and support branch roll‑out.
4. Execution via digital + local branches: mobile‑first LOS + in‑house underwriting and collections is a scalable advantage in Tier‑3/4 markets.
5. Key risks (asset quality, promoter pledge / ownership changes, valuation premium) are manageable but material — investors should use stop losses and monitor quarterly credit metrics closely.
