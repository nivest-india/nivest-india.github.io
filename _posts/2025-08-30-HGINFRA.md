### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | H. G. Infra Engineering Ltd (HGINFRA) |
| **Sector** | Infrastructure / EPC (Roads, Rail, Solar, BESS, T&D) |
| **Current Price** | ₹971 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹6,330 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview

- India’s highway and infrastructure awarding activity is recovering; large NHAI pipeline and state projects are driving multi-year demand for EPC contractors.  
- Renewables (solar) and grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) are emerging high-growth adjacencies for EPC players — policy targets for renewables and grid storage provide structural demand.  
- Hybrid-Annuity-Model (HAM) and EPC/HAM blended portfolios provide both revenue visibility and opportunities for asset monetisation (capability to recycle equity).  
- Competitive landscape: large diversified EPC conglomerates (L&T, Kalpataru, KEC, Techno Electric) and specialised midcap players — execution capability, prequalification status and equipment fleet are key differentiators.  
- Demand drivers: government capital expenditure, NHAI awards, urban‑rail & station redevelopment, state highway programs, and renewables rollout (solar + BESS).

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| NHAI award pipeline (indicative) | ~6,376 km (~₹3.45 lakh Cr) (industry pipeline cited in management commentary) |
| Government highways target (FY26) | ~10,000 km (policy objective signalling intent to award & execute) |
| Renewable target (India) | 450 GW by 2030 (policy tailwind for solar & storage) |
| HG Infra order book (consolidated, Q3 FY25) | ₹15,080 Cr |
| HG Infra FY25 order inflows (9M / disclosed wins) | ~₹8,200 Cr (to Feb 2025 disclosures) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Strong structural tailwinds: large central/state pipelines for roads, rail redevelopments and renewables support sustained order flows.  
- HG Infra is well-positioned in roads (HAM + EPC) and expanding into rail, solar and BESS — diversification reduces single-sector risk.  
- New adjacencies (BESS, T&D) enlarge addressable market and can improve long-term margins if executed.  
- Competitive pressures remain (large EPC peers), but HG’s pre-qualifications, modern fleet (~3,000 equipment) and geographic spread (13 states) are differentiators.

#### Financial Strength: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Consolidated Revenue (FY25) | ₹5,056 Cr |
| Consolidated PAT (FY25) | ₹505 Cr |
| OPM (consolidated FY25) | ~21% (reported consolidated margins FY25) |
| Consolidated borrowings (Mar 2025) | ~₹4,170 Cr |
| Debt / Equity (reported) | 1.41 |
| Interest Coverage | 2.89 |
| Cash Conversion Cycle | -78 days (operating working-capital dynamics driven by high payables) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Operating performance: steady revenues and healthy consolidated EBITDA/PAT margins historically (consolidated EBITDA margin ~20% area) and strong ROE/ROCE (ROE ~18% / ROCE ~17%) are positives.  
- Balance-sheet caution: consolidated borrowings spiked (project and SPV financing for solar/BESS/HAM) and Debt/Equity above 1x increases leverage risk. Interest coverage (~2.9x) is moderate and constrains flexibility if execution slows.  
- Working capital: negative cash-conversion-cycle indicates favourable supplier credit / retention structure, but elevated receivables tied to SPV disbursements and inventory for solar increase near-term funding need.  
- Deleveraging catalyst: management’s HAM monetisation (net equity proceeds ~₹1,384 Cr disclosed) and planned asset recycling should materially reduce consolidated net debt when closed; this is a key balance-sheet event to monitor.  
- Overall: operating profitability is solid, but leverage and project financing create medium-term liquidity/credit risk until monetisation and SPV disbursements materialise.

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P / E (TTM) | ~14.7x |
| Price / Book | ~2.15x |
| EV / EBITDA | ~10.1x |
| Median peer P/E (sample) | 21.0x (peer median from comparable set) |
| Median PBV (sample) | 2.55x |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Relative cheapness: HG Infra trades below peer median on P/E and EV/EBITDA — valuation offers upside if earnings normalise and balance sheet deleverages.  
- Historical justification: stable margins and credible order book support an above-market multiple once asset sales close and SPV cash flows normalise.  
- Risk premium priced in: lower-than-peer multiple reflects leverage and execution risk from new verticals (BESS, solar SPVs) and large equity commitments.  
- Valuation sensitivity: improvement in net debt and sustained 15–16% EBITDA margins would plausibly re-rate the stock toward peer multiples; conversely, delays/renewed working-capital stress would compress multiples.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Order book (consolidated as of Q3 FY25) | ₹15,080 Cr |
| Management FY26 revenue guidance | ~₹7,000 Cr (management commentary) |
| Non‑road order book (rail/solar/BESS) | ~30–40% targeted over 2–3 years |
| BESS contracted (reported) | 735 MW / 1,470 MWh (aggregate contracts disclosed) |
| Solar EPC (KUSUM & other) | ~700 MW DC (EPC value disclosed ~₹2,243 Cr) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Large, converting order book (₹15k Cr) provides multi-year revenue visibility; management target of ₹11k–12k order inflow (FY25 originally) demonstrates an aggressive bidding agenda.  
- Diversification into BESS and T&D opens new recurring-revenue opportunities (BESS fleet/system revenues post-commissioning) and reduces reliance solely on roads.  
- Asset monetisation injects equity and enables bidding for higher‑value HAM projects; monetisation economics (management-stated ~1.8x on invested equity for tranche) create a re‑investment tailwind.  
- Execution risk: conversion depends on appointed dates (ADs), land/DPR timing and SPV disbursements (solar) — delays could postpone growth. Overall growth runway is strong if execution remains disciplined.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding | ~71.8% (major family trusts) |
| Promoter pledge | 0.0% (no pledge reported) |
| Dividend payout (FY25) | Final dividend declared; payout small (~2–3%) |
| Recent corporate actions | HAM monetisation tranches, subsidiary stake sales (as disclosed) |
| Credit ratings | ICRA AA- (Positive) / A1+ reaffirmations (recent) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Ownership: high promoter holding (benefit: aligned long-term ownership; risk: concentrated control) — no promoter pledge is a significant positive.  
- Transparency: frequent investor presentations, concalls and documented guidance; management has shared detailed equity infusion schedules for HAM/solar/BESS.  
- Capital allocation: monetisation of near-complete HAM assets indicates proactive capital recycling; equity commitments and disclosures are transparent.  
- Dividend policy: conservative (low payout) — focus is on reinvestment and deleveraging; acceptable for growth phase.  
- No material governance red flags seen in filings or disclosures; governance rating is constructive.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Broker | Date | Recommendation | Target Price |
|--------|------|----------------|--------------|
| Geojit Financial Services | 07-Mar-2025 | BUY | ₹1,440 |
| Anand Rathi | 26-May-2025 | BUY | ₹1,749 |
| ICICI Securities | 16-Aug-2025 | HOLD | ₹1,000 |
| Anand Rathi (update) | 21-Aug-2025 | BUY | ₹1,339 |
| Emkay Global | 17-Aug-2025 | BUY | ₹1,900 |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Coverage breadth: multiple brokers cover HG Infra; majority carry BUY ratings with targets materially above market — consensus skews positive.  
- Divergence: one large institutional note (ICICI) is cautious (HOLD) reflecting concerns on near-term debt/asset-sale timing.  
- Research thesis: common positive drivers are order-book strength, HAM monetisation, growth into renewables/BESS and eventual multiple expansion. Risks flagged uniformly: SPV disbursements, AD timing and temporary balance-sheet stress.  
- Overall research sentiment is constructive; analyst target range provides reference points and upside scenarios.

#### Technical Analysis: 3/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 50 DMA / 200 DMA (approx) | 50 DMA ~₹1,032 ; 200 DMA ~₹1,140 (stock trading below both) |
| RSI (14) | ~38 (neutral-to-oversold) |
| Momentum / Oscillators | Majority bearish (MACD negative; most oscillators in bearish zone) |
| Price performance 1Y | Decline from 52‑week high ₹1,644 → current ₹971 (-41%) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Price action: the stock is trading below key moving averages (50/200 DMA) and has significant drawdown from 52-week highs, indicating a technical downtrend.  
- Indicators: RSI mid/low range, MACD below center and multiple oscillators signal bearish technical momentum.  
- Volume: intermittent spikes at sell-offs and select accumulations; lack of consistent technical accumulation reduces near-term bullish conviction.  
- Conclusion: technically weak in the near-term; momentum may reverse once catalysts (asset-sale proceeds, ADs, disbursements) materialise.

#### Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Metric | Data Point |
|--------|------------|
| Recent corporate news flow | HAM monetisation tranches (asset sales), project appointed‑dates (New Delhi station AD, subsidiary financial close declarations) |
| Credit actions | ICRA / CARE rating activity reaffirmations (AA- with Positive outlook recently) |
| Analyst commentary | Broker reports largely positive; some caution on debt/timing |
| Price reaction | Market has discounted the stock (significant fall from peaks) despite positive news due to leverage concerns |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Newsflow positive (order wins, appointed dates, HAM monetisation, solar/BESS contracts) and credit rating reaffirmations support sentiment.  
- Market reaction reflects concern over temporary leverage spike and timing of cash inflows from monetisation and SPV disbursements.  
- Sentiment will turn more decisively positive post-visible deleveraging or consistent execution in renewables/BESS. Current sentiment: constructive but cautious.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 8/10

| Holder Category | Latest (Jun 2025) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Promoters | 71.78% |
| FIIs | 2.43% |
| DIIs | 11.65% |
| Public / Others | 14.13% |
| Notable institutional holders | Nippon, HSBC small-cap funds, Abakkus Emerging Opportunities (DIIs noted) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Promoter stake is high and stable — alignment with long-term strategy and no promoter pledge is positive.  
- Quality DIIs present (Nippon, HSBC, Abakkus, AB/Aditya Birla allocations), indicating institutional interest.  
- FIIs relatively small but have shown incremental flows in recent quarters; further FII participation would aid liquidity and rerating.  
- No material insider exits or promoter dilution visible — ownership structure supports long-term execution.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (Rs.Cr.) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE % | EV / EBITDA |
|------|---------------------|-----:|---------:|------:|------------:|
| Larsen & Toubro | 495,322 | 31.87 | 5.07 | 16.6 | 15.8 |
| Rail Vikas | 63,093 | 52.93 | 6.59 | 14.0 | 31.3 |
| NBCC | 26,530 | 41.69 | 10.70 | 25.9 | 23.2 |
| IRB Infra Devl. | 25,907 | 31.05 | 1.31 | 5.9 | 10.8 |
| KEC Intl. | 21,512 | 35.39 | 4.02 | 12.0 | 15.4 |
| Kalpataru Projects | 21,329 | 30.19 | 3.27 | 9.96 | 11.7 |
| Techno Elect. Engg | 17,593 | 40.37 | 4.70 | 12.8 | 31.0 |
| H. G. Infra Engg. | 6,330 | 14.68 | 2.15 | 18.3 | 10.1 |

- HG Infra trades at a discount vs. many listed peers on P/E and EV/EBITDA, reflecting higher leverage and near-term execution risk but also room for rerating if deleveraging and execution prove successful.

## Key Strengths
- Large, diversified order book (~₹15.1k Cr) across highways, rail, solar and BESS providing revenue visibility.  
- Proven execution capability in highways (HAM + EPC) supported by a modern equipment fleet (~3,000 units) and pan-India presence.  
- Active capital‑recycling strategy (HAM monetisation) that can de‑leverage and fund growth adjacencies.  
- High promoter ownership (no pledge) and institutional DII interest; credit ratings in investment grade (AA‑ with positive outlook).  
- Valuation gap vs. peers — scope for multiple expansion on successful deleveraging and margin normalisation.

## Key Concerns  
- Consolidated leverage increased materially (project & SPV financing); interest coverage (~2.9x) is moderate — timing of HAM sale receipts and SPV disbursements is critical.  
- Consolidated reporting optics: solar SPV execution leads to consolidated revenue/PAT elimination until commissioning — creates visibility/translation lags.  
- Execution risk in newer verticals (BESS & T&D) where procurement, supply-chain and technology execution are critical.  
- Technical price weakness and 40%+ fall from 52-week high reflect market scepticism; liquidity at times can be thin.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,600  
**Key Drivers:**  
- Successful and timely monetisation of HAM tranche(s) (net proceeds received within FY26) materially reduces consolidated net debt and interest costs.  
- Order inflow sustains at/above management targets and several large projects reach appointed dates (ADs) delivering revenue ramp; BESS commissioning timeline accelerates and contributes meaningful revenue by FY27.  
- Margins recover to 15–16% consolidated and market rewards de-risked balance sheet with multiple expansion toward 14–16x forward P/E (or EV/EBITDA nearer peers).  
- Improved investor sentiment and institutional flows (DIIs/FIIs) drive re-rating.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,160  
**Key Drivers:**  
- HAM monetisation largely completes within 12 months and reduces net debt materially but some cash receipts and tax adjustments take into the early FY27 timeframe.  
- Management delivers revenue growth to ~FY26 guided range (reconciled consolidated view) and EBITDA margins normalise to ~15% as one-off adjustments reverse.  
- A modest multiple expansion to ~13–14x forward P/E (from current ~14.7x TTM but applied to higher forward EPS) drives the price to the target.  
- This scenario assumes execution on core highways/rail plus gradual traction in solar/BESS with financing disbursements catching up to physical progress.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹820  
**Key Drivers:**  
- Delays in HAM monetisation (partial/late receipts) and slower than expected bank disbursements to solar SPVs leave consolidated leverage elevated for longer, pressuring interest cost and margin.  
- Appointed-dates (ADs) and project readiness for a few key HAM and rail projects are delayed, deferring revenue recognition.  
- Market applies a lower multiple (PE compression toward ~11–12x) because of visible execution/liquidity stress and limited rerating catalysts near-term.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹1,600 | +65% | Strong upside if HAM monetisation & BESS execution accelerate and debt falls rapidly — high reward but execution‑sensitive |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹1,160 | +20% | Most likely outcome: monetisation deleverages, margins normalise to 15% and market gives modest multiple expansion → BUY signal |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹820 | -16% | Outcome with delayed monetisation/disbursements or material project delays — downside risk exists |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**  
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (12‑month horizon) — realistic scenario implies ~20% upside from current price (≥15% threshold used for BUY).  
- **Risk‑Reward Assessment:** Upside is driven by visible deleveraging (HAM sales), order‑book conversion and margin normalisation. Principal risks are timing of cash flows, execution in new verticals (BESS/solar) and temporary elevated leverage. Maintain active monitoring of HAM monetisation closings, SPV bank disbursements and quarterly consolidated cash flows.

## Investment Recommendation

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Recommendation** | BUY (12 months) |
| **Strategy Type** | Core / Medium-term (12 months) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹920 – ₹1,020 |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹850 (initial; trail on positive news/monetisation) |
| **Primary Target** | ₹1,160 (12 months, realistic) |
| **Secondary (optimistic) target** | ₹1,600 (18 months, if execution + monetisation accelerate) |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) — scale in on weakness and on confirmed HAM monetisation receipts |
| **Time Horizon** | 12 months primary; 12–24 months for full thesis (monetisation + BESS ramp) |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**  
- Large order book and a clear strategy to diversify into higher-growth adjacencies (BESS, solar, T&D) make the growth story credible.  
- Valuation is reasonable vs peers; current multiple incorporates balance-sheet risk — successful HAM monetisation and visible debt reduction should unlock re-rating.  
- Near-term risks (timing of cash flows, SPV disbursements) suggest a medium position sizing and step-in approach with stop loss. Monitor cash inflows and appointed dates closely.

## Investment Thesis

1. Order‑book backed growth: A multi‑segment order book of ~₹15k Cr provides 2–3 years of execution visibility; conversion should drive revenue recovery and EPS growth.  
2. Capital recycling & deleveraging catalyst: Monetisation of near-complete HAM SPVs is the single most important balance-sheet catalyst — expected net equity proceeds materially lower consolidated gross/net debt.  
3. Diversification into renewables & BESS: Adds a high-growth, potentially high-margin stream and reduces highways concentration; successful execution of BESS projects will materially increase recurring/annuity‑like revenue.  
4. Attractive relative valuation: Trading below peer multiples (P/E and EV/EBITDA), offering upside if execution and deleveraging progress as guided.  
5. Balanced governance & ownership: High promoter holding (no pledge), institutional DII interest and investment‑grade credit ratings support investor confidence; main risk remains execution/timing rather than governance.
