### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Limited (UJJIVANSFB) |
| **Sector** | Small Finance Banks |
| **Current Price** | ₹42.7 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹8,264 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview

- Small‑finance banks (SFBs) have scaled rapidly over the last cycle as financial inclusion, retail housing and MSME demand expanded; the SFB credit book has grown materially over FY18–FY24, increasing the sector’s relevance for retail credit in India.
- Regulatory shifts (guard‑rails for microfinance, evolving PSL norms for SFBs) are re-shaping product mix strategies; several SFBs are deliberately shifting from unsecured MFI to secured retail (housing, vehicle, gold, MSME).
- Funding dynamics (CASA mobilisation vs term deposits) and NIM sensitivity to policy rates are the primary sector-level earnings drivers.
- Competitive intensity is increasing (other SFBs, smaller private banks and digital lenders); differentiation now hinges on liability franchise and product diversification (secured loans + digital distribution).

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SFB credit book (FY2018) | ~₹21,400 Cr |
| SFB credit book (FY2024) | ~₹55,000 Cr |
| SFB deposits (FY2024) | ~₹51,900 Cr |
| Regulatory environment | MFIN guardrails + PSL calibration (management commentary) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- India’s retail & micro lending demand provides a multi‑year growth runway for SFBs, supporting a positive sector outlook for Ujjivan (structural tailwind).  
- Regulatory guardrails (MFI-specific) increase near-term volatility for group loans but accelerate product diversification — a net positive for well‑capitalised SFBs pivoting to secured loans.  
- Funding environment remains a constraint: CASA gains are key; SFBs that build CASA will sustain margins better — this is a visible industry differentiator.  
- Competitive pressure from larger banks and niche NBFCs means pricing discipline will be tested; winners will be those with distribution + low cost of funds.  
- Overall cyclical sensitivity to rural/SME cycles and policy rates keeps the sector medium‑risk — hence a 7/10 score.

#### Financial Strength: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Assets (FY25) | ₹47,689 Cr |
| Gross Loan Book (FY25) | ₹32,122 Cr |
| Deposits (FY25) | ₹37,630 Cr |
| CRAR (FY25) | 23.1% |
| GNPA / NNPA (FY25) | 2.2% / 0.5% |
| PCR (incl. floating) | 78% |
| Net Profit (FY25) | ₹726 Cr |
| NIM (FY25) | 8.8% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Capital cushion is strong: CRAR ~23% provides ample buffer vs regulatory floor and supports growth and provisioning absorption.  
- Deposit franchise expanded notably (FY25 deposits ₹37,630 Cr, ~+20% YoY) which improves funding stability and reduces reliance on market borrowings.  
- Asset quality has improved from prior stressed years (GNPA 2.2% FY25) and coverage is healthy (PCR ~78%), but recent credit costs spiked in FY25 indicating legacy stress — this is a near‑term earnings drag.  
- Profitability compressed (PAT down YoY) due to elevated provisions; operating profit (PPOP) remains positive but earnings are volatile while provisions normalise.  
- Liquidity and LCR metrics reported by management are conservative; overall financial position is resilient but earnings recovery depends on credit-cost normalisation — hence 7/10.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | ₹42.7 |
| Market Cap | ₹8,264 Cr |
| P/E | 15.6x |
| Price / Book Value (P/BV) | 1.36x |
| Book Value (per share) | ₹31.4 |
| EV / EBITDA | 13.0x |
| Peer median P/E | 15.9x |
| Peer median P/B | 0.95x |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Absolute valuation (P/E ~15.6x, P/B ~1.36x) is not expensive relative to historic SFB re‑rating levels but reflects limited margin of error given credit‑cost uncertainty.  
- Versus immediate peers Ujjivan trades near median on P/E and at a premium on P/B — justified by above‑median ROE but leaves less cushion if fundamentals weaken.  
- Analysts’ targets vary (₹41–₹60) — indicating valuation debate driven by assumptions on credit cost and book‑value multiple re‑rating.  
- If secured‑book shift and CASA gains materialise, multiple expansion to 1.4–1.6x book is plausible; conversely, persistent MFI stress would compress multiples.  
- Given the mixed signals (capital strength vs earnings volatility), valuations are fair but not a deep value; score 6/10.

#### Growth Potential: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross Loan Book FY25 | ₹32,122 Cr (FY25) |
| Secured book (Q4 FY25 / Q1 FY26 commentary) | 44%–46% of advances |
| Deposits FY25 | ₹37,630 Cr (+20% YoY) |
| Management guidance (FY26) | Advances growth guidance ~20% (management commentary) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Rapid secured‑loan expansion (housing, micro‑mortgages, vehicle, gold) materially improves risk‑adjusted growth potential and earnings quality over medium term.  
- Strong deposit mobilisation (CASA ~25–27% target) gives room for low‑cost funding — a structural driver for margins and scalable growth.  
- Universal‑bank application, if approved, is a material optionality (broader product set, larger corporate deposits, current accounts) — upside catalyst.  
- Execution risk exists: scaling secured products profitably requires underwriting / distribution execution; microfinance stress could still weigh.  
- Overall growth runway is solid provided credit costs normalise and execution continues; 7/10 reflects good growth potential with execution risk.

#### Corporate Governance: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Board / Management changes | New MD & CEO (S. Nautiyal) effective Jul 2024; other senior hires |
| Reverse merger | Reverse merger with UFSL completed May 2024 (equity allotment) |
| ESOP activity | Multiple ESOP allotments across 2023–2025 (material issuance) |
| Regulatory actions | Small RBI penalty (Rs. 6.70 lakh) and tax penalty item noted; NPA sales executed |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management reset (experienced senior hires) is positive — fresh leadership with banking experience is a governance positive for strategic execution.  
- Reverse merger and capital actions were large and materially altered ownership/float — well‑executed legally but raised complexity in shareholding and governance disclosure for a period.  
- Extensive ESOP issuances across 2024–25 should be monitored for dilution and compensation governance — transparency on long‑term incentives is important.  
- No major governance scandals; regulatory penalties are minor. Board appears active (universal bank application approved by Board).  
- Net: governance is sound operationally but ESOP scale and post‑merger ownership mechanics justify a cautious 6/10.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Broker | Date | Recommendation | Target |
|--------|------|----------------|--------|
| ICICI Securities | 26 Jul 2024 | BUY | ₹60 |
| Emkay | 25 Oct 2024 | BUY | ₹45 |
| Emkay | 24 Jan 2025 | BUY | ₹45 |
| Geojit | 04 Feb 2025 | ACCUMULATE | ₹41 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Coverage is active and generally constructive — multiple brokers (ICICI, Emkay, Geojit) see upside driven by secured‑book transition and re‑rating potential.  
- Reports converge on the thesis: asset‑quality normalisation + secured mix + CASA improvements = book‑value re‑rating; differences lie in credit‑cost assumptions.  
- Broker targets range widely (₹41–₹60) reflecting model sensitivity to provisioning and NIM assumptions; this variance underlines model risk.  
- Analysts note RBI filing for universal‑bank licence as an important optionality that could influence longer‑term multiples.  
- Research coverage is robust and supportive, hence 7/10.

#### Technical Analysis: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 1‑Year Range | ₹30.88 — ₹51.87 |
| 50 DMA | ~₹44.6 |
| 200 DMA | ~₹42.6 |
| RSI (14) | ~41 |
| Momentum / Trend | Neutral to slightly bearish recently (momentum score ~57) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is below the 50‑day average and near the 200‑day average — mixed near‑term technicals with limited upside conviction.  
- Oscillators (RSI ~41, MACD negative) are mildly bearish/neutral — not a strong technical buy signal.  
- Longer term, the stock recovered from a low near ₹31 to >₹48 in June 2025, showing capacity for rallies on positive news/catalysts.  
- Volumes have spiked on select up-moves (indicative of episodic institutional interest) — watch for confirmation on SMA/EMA crossovers.  
- Technicals are neutral/short‑term cautious — score 5/10.

#### Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Sentiment Indicator | Recent Signal |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Analyst consensus | Predominantly BUY / ACCUMULATE (mixed targets) |
| Corporate events | Universal‑bank application filed (Feb 2025); reverse merger completed (May 2024) |
| Asset‑quality actions | ARC sales / NPA sales executed (FY25) |
| Institutional flows | Notable FII entries (IFC, Duro, Newquest) post‑amalgamation |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Market sentiment is cautiously constructive: analysts largely positive and FIIs have accumulated meaningful stakes — supportive for valuation.  
- Universal bank filing and secured‑book traction are visible positive catalysts that the market rewards if execution continues.  
- Near‑term negative sentiment stems from elevated credit cost and earnings volatility in FY25; this has constrained multiple expansion despite strong fundamentals in deposits and capital.  
- News flow (ARC sales, floating provisions) shows management active in cleaning the balance sheet — improving sentiment once such actions are digested.  
- Net sentiment is cautiously positive — 7/10.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 5/10

| Period | Promoters | FIIs | DIIs | Public |
|--------|-----------|------|------|--------|
| Mar 2024 | 73.52% | 3.48% | 2.33% | 20.67% |
| Mar 2025 | 0.00% | 19.51% | 8.47% | 72.03% |
| Jun 2025 | 0.00% | 19.55% | 16.82% | 63.61% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Pre‑amalgamation promoter holding was high (~73%); post‑amalgamation classification and large allotments materially changed on‑paper promoter numbers — this structural change increased public float and institutional participation.  
- Significant FII participation (International Finance Corporation, Duro, Newquest, Bowhead) is an institutional vote of confidence; presence of marquee FIIs is positive for governance and long‑term stability.  
- Rapid increase in retail/public float increases liquidity but reduces the traditional “promoter skin‑in‑the‑game” signal; the promoter/ownership transition should be monitored for clarity.  
- Recent notable public investors (select high‑conviction retail funds / investors) are positive, but promoter reclassification creates governance/ownership transparency questions to watch.  
- Overall: institutional endorsement balanced by promoter/ownership complexity — 5/10.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (₹ Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE % |
|------|-------------------:|----:|---------:|------:|
| AU Small Finance | ₹53,541.53 Cr | 24.51 | 3.11 | 14.19% |
| Ujjivan Small Finance | ₹8,264.00 Cr | 15.64 | 1.36 | 12.42% |
| Equitas Small Finance | ₹5,733.00 Cr | - | 0.94 | 2.43% |
| Jana Small Finance | ₹5,162.95 Cr | 11.93 | 1.25 | 13.03% |

## Key Strengths
- Strong capital adequacy (CRAR ~23%) and sizeable liquidity buffer provide headroom to absorb near‑term shocks.  
- Rapid, credible shift toward secured lending (housing, micro‑mortgages, vehicle, gold) improving risk‑adjusted returns.  
- Healthy deposit mobilisation (retail TD + CASA) reduces funding stress; CASA improving (management target ~27–30%).  
- Active management actions (ARC sales, provisioning) show willingness to clean up legacy stress.  
- Supportive broker coverage and meaningful FII participation create potential re‑rating catalysts.

## Key Concerns  
- FY25 earnings compressed materially due to surge in credit costs; normalization timeline uncertain and materially moves valuation.  
- Microfinance (group loans) remains a risk pocket in selective geographies (Karnataka / TN historically); localized stress may reappear.  
- Promoter/ownership reclassification and large ESOP issuances require monitoring for dilution and governance clarity.  
- Margin sensitivity to cost of funds and secured‑mix yield differential means NIM could moderate before stabilising.  
- Universal‑bank licence is optionality but approval and time‑to‑benefit are uncertain.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹65 (24 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Successful execution of secured‑book scale (≥45% of advances), CASA improvement to 30%+, credit cost normalises to <1.5% p.a., and market awards a higher P/B multiple (1.6–1.8x) aided by universal‑bank optionality and stronger fee income. Re‑rating driven by visible pickup in core RoA/ROE and reduced provisioning volatility.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹50 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Secured‑book growth continues, deposit franchise improves (CASA ~27%), credit cost declines toward management guidance (~2.3% FY26 then trending down), book value increases modestly and market gives a moderate premium (P/B ~1.4x). This implies ~+17% upside from CMP.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹30 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Continued slippages in microfinance (new stress pockets or slower collection improvement), credit cost stays elevated (>3% p.a.), provisions persist and erode core EPS; market compresses multiple to ~0.9–1.0x book. This scenario results in material downside.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|--------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹65 | +52% | Strong execution + multiple re‑rating; high reward but conditional on universal‑bank / sustained NIM improvement |
| Realistic | ₹50 | +17% | Moderated growth + normalising credit cost → BUY (meets ≥15% upside criterion) |
| Pessimistic | ₹30 | -30% | Continued credit stress / multiple compression → downside risk |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (12‑month realistic target ₹50 → ~+17% upside from CMP ₹42.7).  
- **Risk‑Reward Assessment:** The upside (≈17%) is balanced by a sizeable downside (pessimistic -30%). Upside hinges on continued secured‑book scaling, deposit quality improvement and normalisation of credit cost. Given capital strength and visible execution, a measured BUY is warranted for investors with tolerance for cyclical credit risk.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price | Position Size | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------:|----------:|-------------:|--------------:|---------:|
| BUY (Accumulate) | Medium‑term tactical/strategic | ₹38 — ₹44 | ₹32 (≈ -25% from entry low) | ₹50 (12 months) | Medium (2–5% portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Ujjivan has strong capital and deposit traction while executing a credible secured‑book transition that should improve asset quality and risk‑adjusted returns over 12–24 months.  
- Earnings are currently depressed due to elevated provisioning; a buy for accumulation (not full allocation) is appropriate while monitoring GNPA/credit cost trends.  
- Use staged entries around ₹38–44 to reduce timing risk; stop loss at ₹32 for defined downside control.

## Investment Thesis
1. Capital and liquidity provide an immediate buffer: CRAR ~23% and strong deposit growth means the bank can absorb near‑term provisioning while continuing to lend.  
2. Secured‑book pivot materially de‑risks the portfolio over the medium term (housing, micro‑mortgages, vehicle, gold), improving risk‑adjusted yields and lowering volatility in credit costs.  
3. Liability franchise expansion (CASA growth) is a key operational win — lower cost of funds supports margin maintenance even as secured mix rises.  
4. Universal‑bank application is a meaningful optionality that can unlock higher franchise multiples if approved, but it should be treated as a multi‑quarter catalyst rather than immediate upside.  
5. Near‑term valuation is reasonable (P/B ~1.36, P/E ~15.6) — attractive for patient investors if credit cost normalisation occurs; however, monitor GNPA trends and regional stress pockets closely.
