### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Bajaj Finance Limited (BAJFINANCE) |
| **Sector** | Financial Services (NBFC) |
| **Current Price** | ₹878 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹5,46,241 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- Consumer finance / NBFC segment remains a structural growth area in India driven by under-penetration, digitisation, and rising retail credit demand; NBFC leaders with scale and tech capabilities tend to capture disproportionate share of incremental retail volumes.
- Interest-rate cycle easing and cheaper wholesale funding (visible in H1‑FY26 guidance) should support margin recovery for well‑capitalised NBFCs but will vary by funding mix and asset re-pricing speed.
- Competitive pressure (banks + fintechs) is highest in cards, mortgages and small-ticket personal loans; incumbents win on distribution, cross-sell and underwriting data advantages.
- Regulatory oversight has increased after recent years of NBFC expansion; capital buffers and conservative ALM/liquidity remain differentiators for investors.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Consolidated AUM (FY25) | ₹4,16,661 Cr |
| Customer franchise (FY25) | 101.82 Mn |
| Company market share (credit, approx.) | ~2.14% of India’s total credit |
| Cost of funds (FY25) | 7.97% |
| NIM / Financing margin | Stabilising; management guides modest improvement |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Large addressable market: India consumer credit remains under‑penetrated and Bajaj Finance’s diversified product portfolio positions it to capture secular growth in retail, mortgage, SME and gold loans.
- Scale & distribution edge: 100M+ customer franchise, ~4.2K locations and >200K distribution points provide durable customer acquisition advantage vs newer fintechs.
- Interest-rate tailwind: Management expects incremental easing in cost of funds (guidance FY26); this should support modest NIM expansion if pass‑through and deployment align.
- Competitive & regulatory intensity: Banks and fintechs pressurise pricing in mortgages/cards; regulatory scrutiny on NBFCs remains a watch item which raises execution complexity.
- Short-term segment headwinds (MSME, some auto portfolios) temper the otherwise strong secular sector outlook.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CRAR (FY25) | 21.9% |
| ROE (FY25) | 19.2% |
| ROA (FY25) | ~4.6% |
| PAT (FY25 consolidated) | ₹16,779 Cr |
| Total borrowings (Mar 2025) | ₹3,61,249 Cr |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong capital cushions: CRAR ~22% (Tier‑1 ~21%) gives ample buffer for growth and provisioning shocks; management flagged surplus capital post QIP/BHFL listing.
- High profitability metrics: ROE ~19% and ROA in mid‑single digits are attractive for a large NBFC and have been delivered consistently historically.
- Rapid, well‑funded growth: AUM grew ~26% YoY to ₹4.16 lakh Cr (FY25); growth funded by mix of borrowings, NCDs, deposits and securitisation — balance sheet expanded materially.
- Liquidity & ALM: Liquidity buffer (mid‑FY25) ~₹14–19k Cr; LCR well above regulatory floors — provides cushion against short-term market dislocations.
- Cashflow dynamics: Operating cash flow is negative while the company grows loan book (typical for lenders); free cash flow across the industry is negative during scaling phases — monitor funding spreads & securitisation execution.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/E (current) | 31.35 |
| Price / Book (current) | 5.64 |
| EV / EBITDA | 17.8 |
| Median PE (12m) | ~31.8 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Premium multiples: BAJFINANCE trades at notably higher P/E and P/B than the peer median (peer median P/E ~21.3), reflecting high ROE and growth but leaving limited margin of safety.
- Growth premium partly justified: Strong AUM/customer growth and superior ROE underpin the premium — however any persistent credit‑cost uptick or margin pressure would compress multiples quickly.
- Peer context: Peers trade a wide range — some (Shriram) materially cheaper on P/E; SBI Cards trades richer. Bajaj’s premium is defendable but valuation sensitivity to credit cost is high.
- EV/EBITDA elevated vs median: Implies market prices in secular growth and operating leverage; investors must be comfortable paying for execution.
- Balanced view: Not a deep-value case; upside depends on execution of FinAI/efficiency and re‑rating resilience.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM growth (FY25) | 26% YoY |
| FY26 AUM guidance | 24–25% |
| New loans booked (FY25) | 43.42 Mn |
| Customer franchise growth (FY25) | 101.82 Mn vs 83.6 Mn |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High organic growth: Consistent >20% AUM growth and record customer additions (14–16 Mn guidance) provide a visible growth runway.
- Product & distribution diversification: Growth levers include mortgages (BHFL), gold loans (fast add), SME, payments & broking (BFSL), and strategic partnerships (e.g., Airtel) to widen reach.
- FinAI (AI-first) program: Management expects AI deployment to materially improve underwriting, collections and opex — credible upside if delivery matches plan.
- Execution risk: Growth quality matters — management’s pruning of stressed segments (2W/3W, some MSME) shows discipline but temporarily slows some volumes.
- Medium-term upside: If credit cost normalises to guided range and NIMs stabilise/improve slightly, earnings compounding supports high EPS growth.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding | 54.7% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.00% |
| Recent leadership change | MD resignation (Jul 2025); Rajeev Jain appointed VC & MD till Mar 2028 |
| Dividend policy (FY25) | Special + Final dividends declared; payout ~19–21% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong promoter alignment: High promoter stake and zero pledge are positive for long-term orientation.
- Transparent capital allocation: Value unlocking via BHFL IPO, QIP, dividends, bonus and clear capital metrics demonstrates discipline.
- Leadership transition: Resignation of MD drew short-term attention; board’s internal appointment (Rajeev Jain) supports continuity — monitor mid‑term succession/strategy continuity.
- Active investor communication: Frequent concalls and detailed investor presentations show robust disclosure practices.
- ESOPs & incentives: Ongoing ESOP allotments align management incentives with long-term value creation; track dilution over time.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Broker | Date | Call / TP |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Mirae Asset / Sharekhan | 28 Jul 2025 | BUY / TP ₹1,000 |
| Prabhudas Lilladher | 25 Jul 2025 | HOLD / TP ₹900 |
| Motilal Oswal | 24 May 2025 | NEUTRAL / TP ₹1,000 |
| (Other broker notes reviewed) | May–Jul 2025 | Mixed BUY / HOLD views |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Coverage breadth: Strong analyst coverage with multiple buy/neutral opinions and target prices clustered around ₹900–1,000 (consensus ~₹1,000).
- Core thesis commonality: Analysts point to sustained AUM growth, improving efficiency (AI), and robust capital as the basis for positive stance.
- Divergent risk view: Some brokers (HOLD) focus on rich valuation and near‑term credit cost uncertainty — a valid counterpoint.
- No major outlier sell reports: Research consensus is constructive but valuation implies execution must be flawless.
- Usefulness: Broker reports help triangulate fair value band (₹900–1,000) and reinforce the realistic scenario used in our recommendation.

#### Technical Analysis: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last Trade | ₹877.85 |
| 50 DMA | ~₹899 |
| 200 DMA | ~₹853 |
| RSI (14) | 44.4 |
| Momentum Score | Neutral (~52) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short-term weak to neutral: Price trading below the 50‑DMA but above the 200‑DMA — short‑term consolidation; sell signals on some oscillators (MACD negative).
- Long-term trend intact: Above 200‑DMA and higher‑highs earlier in 2025 indicate multi‑quarter uptrend remains intact.
- Support/resistance: Near‑term support band ~₹852–870; resistance ~₹900–940.
- Volume: Trading liquidity healthy — institutional participation visible.
- Technical view consistent with fundamental: neutral/constructive for medium term, but short‑term retracements possible.

#### Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Item | Recent signal |
|------|---------------|
| Q1 FY26 reaction | Mixed: strong results but intra‑day decline on leadership change |
| Ratings | Recent upgrades (S&P/others) supportive |
| Corporate actions | Bonus, split and strong dividends positive for sentiment |
| Analyst flow | Predominantly BUY/Neutral, limited SELL calls |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Q1 FY26 beat: Strong Q1 metrics (AUM, disbursements, PAT growth) support positive sentiment; management guidance credible.
- Governance noise: MD resignation created a near‑term negative headline; appointment of Rajeev Jain restored some confidence.
- Institutional interest: FIIs/DIIs remain meaningful owners; ratings upgrades and investor roadshows support flows.
- Media & analyst tone: Predominantly constructive but cautious about credit-cost outlook — balanced sentiment.
- Market price action: Re-rated materially in past 12 months but remains sensitive to news flow (credit/leadership).

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 9/10

| Holder | Jun 2025 |
|--------|----------|
| Promoters | 54.73% |
| FIIs | 21.71% |
| DIIs | 14.52% |
| Public / Others | ~9.0% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High quality ownership mix: Strong promoter holding plus significant FII/DII participation provides stability and capital access.
- No pledge risk: Promoter pledge is nil — reduces one common corporate governance red flag.
- Institutional confidence rising: Gradual FII / DII allocations over the past 12–18 months indicate institutional conviction.
- ESOP allotments controlled: Management incentivisation via ESOPs is visible but not materially dilutive at present levels.
- Shareholder returns: Board actions (bonus, special dividend) reflect shareholder-friendly posture.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (₹Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE% |
|------|------------------:|----:|---------:|-----:|
| Bajaj Finance | 5,46,241.0 | 31.35 | 5.64 | 19.22 |
| Cholamandalam Investment & Finance | 1,19,510.5 | 26.84 | 5.05 | 19.71 |
| Shriram Finance | 1,09,140.2 | 12.83 | 1.93 | 15.57 |
| Muthoot Finance | 1,05,899.4 | 17.21 | 3.61 | 19.58 |
| SBI Cards | 76,455.3 | 40.72 | 5.55 | 14.82 |
| HDB Financial Services | 64,556.9 | 29.67 | n/a | 14.72 |
| Authum Invest | 54,909.2 | 13.40 | 3.76 | 34.12 |

Peer commentary: Bajaj Finance trades at the upper end of P/E/P/B conversation vs many NBFC peers — justified by leading ROE, scale and growth, but provides less margin for error on asset‑quality or margin misses.

## Key Strengths
- Market-leading NBFC with diversified product mix and very large customer franchise (100M+).
- Strong capitalisation (CRAR ~22%), significant liquidity buffers and multiple funding channels.
- Scalable digital distribution (app + omnipresence) and clear FinAI programme to drive productivity and credit analytics.
- Proven execution on growth and cross‑sell; consistent ROE and profitability track record.
- Shareholder-friendly capital actions (dividend, bonus, BHFL listing) and zero promoter pledge.

## Key Concerns  
- Elevated credit costs in FY25 / Q1 FY26 and pockets of stress in MSME and legacy 2W/3W books — key downside risk.
- Rich absolute valuation; market is pricing high execution confidence and low downside.
- Management transition (MD resignation) introduces temporary governance/leadership uncertainty though internal continuity was arranged.
- Funding‑mix sensitivity: reliance on market borrowings and NCDs makes earnings sensitive to funding spreads.
- Large negative operating cashflow while balance sheet scales — typical for lenders but requires continued market access.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,250 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Faster-than-expected normalisation of credit costs (credit cost falls to <1.6% AUF), 25%+ AUM growth, NIM expansion of 10–20 bps from funding mix improvement, and multiple expansion (P/E moves toward 36–38) as AI efficiency gains and BHFL listing unlock ROE upside.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,050 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management guides AUM growth 24–25% and credit cost 1.85–1.95% FY26; EPS growth ~15–18% (from TTM EPS ~28 to ~33) and market assigns a stable multiple near historical median (P/E ~31–32), yielding ~20% price upside.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹700 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Broader macro slowdown and a renewed deterioration in MSME/auto vintages increases credit cost materially (>2.2% AUF), margin compression and multiple contraction to P/E ~20–22 or P/B compression to ~4x produce ~‑20% downside.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|--------------:|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹1,250 | +42% | Execution + re‑rating; best case if credit normalises faster and AI benefits accelerate. |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹1,050 | +20% | Balanced outcome aligned with management guidance and analyst consensus; primary basis for BUY. |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹700 | ‑20% | Material credit shock / funding stress; downside risk if stress widens. |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY — realistic-case shows ~20% upside vs current price (≥15% threshold for BUY).  
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Upside (~+20%) materially exceeds downside (~‑20%) in scenario set, with asymmetric reward if management executes FinAI and credit control plans. Maintain position size discipline given valuation.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price | Position Size | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------:|----------:|-------------:|---------------:|---------:|
| BUY | Core / Growth with risk control | ₹820 — ₹900 | ₹760 (≈‑13% from CMP) | ₹1,050 (12 months) | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- High-quality franchise with strong scale, diversified product mix, and durable cross‑sell gives high probability of earnings compounding.
- Management has credible plans (FinAI, deposits mix, pruning risky segments) to bring credit costs within guided band and improve operating efficiency.
- Current valuation already prices growth but realistic scenario shows meaningful upside (~20%) — hence BUY with entry discipline.
- Key watch-items: execution on AI, credit‑cost trajectory (early‑vintage performance), leadership continuity and funding spreads.

## Investment Thesis
1. Durable franchise economics: Bajaj Finance’s large customer base, high cross-sell potential and diversified AUM mix underpin high ROE and earnings visibility.
2. Growth with prudence: Management targets 24–25% AUM growth for FY26 while pruning higher-risk pockets — growth is strong and increasingly driven by newer, secured products.
3. Margin & cost upside available via funding mix and FinAI: modest NIM uptick plus expected OPEX/NTI improvement (40–50 bps) should enhance medium‑term profitability.
4. Capital & liquidity strength: CRAR ~22% and sizeable liquidity buffers reduce tail‑risk and support sustained growth even under stress.
5. Valuation requires execution: Market prices premium multiples — positive risk‑reward if management executes on credit normalisation and AI benefits; otherwise valuation is vulnerable.
