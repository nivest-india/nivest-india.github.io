### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Bajaj Finance Ltd (BAJFINANCE) |
| **Sector** | NBFC / Financial Services |
| **Current Price** | ₹878 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹5,46,241 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- The Indian NBFC / consumer-finance sector continues to grow faster than system credit — structural tailwinds from formalisation, digital distribution and rising retail credit demand support multi-year growth.
- Funding dynamics are cyclical: an easing in market rates (CP/NCD) has started to lower cost-of-funds but wholesale funding remains sensitive to market conditions and liquidity.
- Regulatory scrutiny and higher risk‑weights on unsecured products mean underwriters must remain conservative; asset-quality cycles (MSME, unsecured) can cause episodic stress.
- Digital platforms, distribution scale and data/AI-driven underwriting are the main competitive moats for retail NBFCs going forward.
- Competitive intensity in mortgages and high-ticket retail is rising (banks + fintechs), while secured segments (gold, mortgages) offer better risk-adjusted returns.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Bajaj Finance | Peer median / Note |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| P/E (current) | 31.4x | Peer median ~21.3x |
| P/BV (current) | 5.6x | Peer median ~1.9x |
| NBFC AUM growth (company TTM) | ~25% | High vs sector averages |
| Key tailwind | Digital customer acquisition, FinAI | Structural |

**Score Reasoning:**
- India’s retail credit penetration remains low vs GDP; this structural gap supports sustained AUM growth for well-run NBFCs (Bajaj Finance is a clear beneficiary).
- Distribution scale + a large digital franchise (100m+ customers) is a substantial moat versus smaller peers and new entrants.
- The sector is interest-rate & macro-cycle sensitive; credit-cost cycles (MSME/unsecured) remain a key tail risk.
- Regulatory attention on unsecured credit and risk-weights can temporarily alter economics, increasing short-term uncertainty.
- Overall sector dynamics favor large, diversified NBFCs with strong funding access and technology — positive for Bajaj Finance.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Metric | Latest (consolidated) |
|--------|------------------------|
| AUM (FY25) | ₹4,16,661 Cr |
| AUM YoY growth (FY25) | ~26% YoY |
| PAT (FY25) | ₹16,779 Cr (FY25); TTM PAT ~₹17,600 Cr |
| ROE (FY25) | 19.2% |
| ROA (FY25) | 4.6% |
| GNPA / NNPA (FY25) | 0.96% / 0.44% |
| CRAR (FY25) | 21.9% |
| Debt / Equity | 3.74x |
| Cost of funds (FY25) | 7.97% |
| Liquidity buffer (Q1 FY26) | ~₹15,000 Cr (management disclosure) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Scale + profitability: AUM ~₹4.17 lakh Cr and TTM PAT ~₹17.6k Cr show a high-quality profitable franchise with ROE ~19% — very strong for an NBFC.
- Capital & liquidity: CRAR ~21.9% and a meaningful liquidity buffer provide a cushion for near-term stress and growth funding.
- Asset quality: GNPA/NNPA remain low in absolute terms (sub‑1% GNPA) but have ticked up; management is conservative on high-risk segments which should help contain future slippages.
- Funding & leverage: Debt/Equity ~3.7x is high (normal for NBFCs) and the company’s mix is shifting away from retail deposits toward diversified wholesale sources — this reduces some rate risk but increases market funding dependence.
- Cash flow / provisioning: Elevated credit costs in FY25 / Q1 FY26 (model refresh and higher provisions) are a warning sign but management guidance expects improvement — balance sheet remains high-quality but needs monitoring.

#### Valuations: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/E (current) | ~31x |
| P/BV (current) | ~5.6x |
| EV / EBITDA | ~17.8x |
| Median sector P/E | ~21x |
| BV per share (latest) | ~₹156 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Valuation premium: Bajaj Finance trades at a significant premium to the median NBFC (P/E and P/B well above peers) reflecting superior ROE, growth and execution track record.
- Growth vs multiple: Current multiples bake in continued high earnings growth; margin for error is limited if credit costs or growth disappoint.
- Relative attractiveness: Compared to peers the premium is justified by brand, distribution and returns, but absolute levels limit upside from multiple compression risk.
- Re-rating potential exists if credit costs normalize and earnings accelerate — but this outcome is uncertain and already partially priced in.
- Conclusion: high quality but valuation is expensive; merits Buy only if forward EPS growth and multiple expansion materialize.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Latest / Guidance |
|--------|-------------------|
| New loans booked (FY25) | 43.42 Mn (FY25) |
| Customer franchise (FY25) | 101.82 Mn |
| AUM guidance (FY26 management) | 24–25% AUM growth |
| Fee income growth guidance | 13–15% (FY26 guidance) |
| Subsidiary AUM (BHFL FY25) | ₹1,14,684 Cr |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High organic growth runway: Management guidance (24–25% AUM growth FY26) is credible given the distribution strength and product breadth (mortgages, gold, SME, consumer).
- Cross-sell & digital: Large customer base and digital investments (FinAI / super‑app) can materially increase fee income and lower cost per acquisition, improving returns over time.
- Product diversification: Growth in secured products (gold, mortgages) and the expansion of BHFL provides alternate high-quality growth levers.
- Risks to growth: MSME stress and slowdown in selected segments (2W/3W) will cap near-term growth in some pockets; management has proactively pruned higher-risk segments.
- Overall: strong multi-year growth potential if credit costs are contained and digital initiatives scale.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Promoter holding | 54.7% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.0% |
| Dividend payout (FY25) | ~21% |
| Recent corporate actions | Bonus, stock-split, special dividend (FY25) |
| Management continuity | Rajeev Jain extended as MD until Mar 2028 (succession planning ongoing) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong promoter alignment: High promoter holding and zero pledge indicate stable long-term ownership and aligned incentives.
- Shareholder returns: Regular dividends, special/bonus distributions and capital actions reflect a shareholder-friendly stance when capital is surplus.
- Management & transparency: Management provides clear guidance (credit cost, AUM) and proactive communications; FinAI strategy disclosed publicly.
- Succession & structure: Leadership transition and internal succession are being managed publicly — positive, but should be tracked for execution risk.
- Governance track record: No major governance red flags; overall governance quality is strong for a large NBFC.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Broker | Date | Recommendation | Target |
|--------|------|----------------|--------|
| Sharekhan / Mirae Asset | 28 Jul 2025 | BUY | ₹1,000 |
| Motilal Oswal | 24 May 2025 | NEUTRAL | ₹1,000 |
| Prabhudas Lilladher | 25 Jul 2025 | HOLD | ₹900 |
| Other broker notes | May–Jul 2025 | Mixed (Buy / Neutral / Hold) | Various |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Wide analyst coverage: Multiple large brokers provide coverage with targets in a narrow band (≈₹900–1,000) — good coverage reduces information asymmetry.
- Consensus view: Analysts acknowledge strong growth & franchise but flag credit-cost and valuation risks — consistent and balanced research coverage.
- Recent reports incorporate FY26 credit-cost guidance and Q1 results — brokers are actively updating models.
- Utility: Research adds value for benchmarking and scenario analysis; diversity of views (Buy/Neutral/Hold) is constructive.
- Availability: High-quality broker research available recently — supports institutional-grade monitoring.

#### Technical Analysis: 4/10

| Indicator | Latest |
|-----------|--------|
| Current price | ₹878 |
| 50 DMA | ~₹899 |
| 200 DMA | ~₹853 |
| MA signal | Trading below 7 of 8 SMAs/EMAs (short-term weakness) |
| RSI (14) | ~44 (neutral) |
| Momentum | Neutral to weak short-term |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short-term trend: The stock is trading below most short-term moving averages → technical bias is neutral-to-bearish in the near term.
- Momentum indicators (RSI/MACD) are neutral to slightly negative — no strong buy signal technically.
- Long-term trend remains positive (price above 200 DMA historically), supporting a medium-term constructive view.
- Volatility & volume: Periods of strong volume accompany moves; position sizing should account for volatility.
- Conclusion: Technicals do not currently support aggressive near-term entries; better risk-reward appears over a 6–12 month horizon.

#### Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Signal | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Recent news flow | Q1 FY26 results: positive growth but MSME stress flagged |
| Concall tone | Cautiously optimistic; proactive on risk management |
| Broker stance | Mixed (Buy/Neutral/Hold) |
| Investor flows | FIIs ~21.7% (stable), DIIs ~14.5% (steady) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Q1 FY26 was operationally strong but flagged MSME stress and elevated credit costs — sentiment is mixed (growth vs. credit worries).
- Market reaction has been volatile around quarterly releases; short‑term sentiment can swing on credit-cost outcomes and macro data.
- Analyst community remains constructive overall, but valuation sensitivity means sentiment can reverse quickly on negative surprises.
- Institutional interest (FIIs and DIIs) remains meaningful and supportive; promoter non-pledge is a positive.
- Net: sentiment constructive medium-term, but cautious near-term.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 9/10

| Holder | Latest (Jun 2025) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Promoters | 54.73% |
| FIIs | 21.71% |
| DIIs | 14.52% |
| Public / Others | ~8.92% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.0% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High promoter stake (54.7%) with zero pledge is a strong governance and alignment positive.
- Institutional ownership (FIIs + DIIs ~36%+) provides steady, informed investor base; FIIs have been active.
- Recent quarters show stable promoter holdings and steady institutional participation — no large exit signals.
- No material promoter dilution or related-party concerns evident — shareholding quality is high.
- Overall this is an important structural strength supporting the stock’s stability.

Notes: Peer metrics show Bajaj Finance trades at a premium on P/E and P/B but delivers superior ROE and scale — the premium reflects quality and growth expectations.

## Key Strengths
- Market leader with a diversified retail lending franchise and wide distribution/digital reach (100m+ customers, 232k distribution points).
- Strong profitability and returns (ROE ~19%, ROA ~4.6%); large operating scale delivers operating leverage.
- Robust capital position (CRAR ~21.9%) and a sizeable liquidity buffer to manage stress or opportunity.
- Active, transparent management with clear guidance (AUM, credit-cost) and visible AI/digital strategy (FinAI).
- Clean promoter holding (54.7%) with zero pledge and meaningful institutional ownership.

## Key Concerns  
- Elevated credit cost in FY25 / Q1 FY26 and signs of stress in parts of the MSME and non-prime portfolios; monitoring required.
- Valuation premium is high (P/B ~5.6x, P/E ~31x); downside risk if credit-costs stay elevated or growth slows.
- Funding mix moving toward wholesale (NCDs, bank borrowings); increases sensitivity to market liquidity and spread movements.
- Short-term technicals are weak — price could underperform in a risk-off market.
- Geographic / sectoral pockets (e.g., Karnataka exposures, 2W/3W book) require continued active risk management.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,350 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Faster-than-guided AUM growth (27–30%), credit costs decline to <1.6% as vintage cures, NIM expansion 20–25 bps due to falling CoF, and multiple expansion to ~37x on stronger earnings visibility. Upside driven by both earnings and rerating.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,060 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Company meets management guidance (AUM +24–25%), credit cost normalizes toward 1.85–1.95%, NIM broadly stable with a small improvement (~10 bps), EPS grows ~18–20% and market sustains a ~31–32x P/E for the stock. This is the base-case used for our recommendation.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹650 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Credit-cost trajectory worsens (credit cost >2.2%), MSME / unsecured stress deepens, AUM growth slows materially (<15–18%), and multiples compress (P/E falls into mid‑20s) — leading to significant downside.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|--------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹1,350 | +54% | Strong re-rating + fast recovery in credit costs; high reward but conditional on favorable execution and macro tailwinds. |
| Realistic | ₹1,060 | +21% | Based on management guidance and conservative earnings growth; primary scenario and basis for recommendation. |
| Pessimistic | ₹650 | -26% | Material downside if credit cycle deepens or funding stress increases; acts as stop-loss planning scenario. |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (12-month horizon).  
  Rationale: realistic scenario implies ~+21% upside vs CMP and multiple pillars (scale, profitability, capital, growth) score highly. The valuation is rich but reasonable given the company’s execution and guidance — reward > risk at the base-case.
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Upside (~+21%) vs downside (~-26% in bear case). The asymmetric return (base-case positive) supports a BUY for investors who accept sector/credit-cycle risk; otherwise prefer staggered entry or partial exposure.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price (12m) | Position Size |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------:|----------:|--------------------:|---------------|
| BUY | Core / Long-term (12 months) | ₹820 – ₹920 | ₹760 (hard stop) | ₹1,060 (base-case) | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Business quality: market leadership, diversified product mix, and digital scale drive durable earnings growth.
- Capital & liquidity: ample buffers and an improving funding mix enhance resilience.
- Valuation: premium is justified by ROE and growth but requires execution; base-case target provides reasonable upside (~+21%).
- Risk management: management is proactively pruning high-risk pockets (2W/3W, MSME) and has clear credit-cost guidance — that improves visibility.
- Tactical note: due to short-term technical weakness and possible episodic credit headlines, use staggered entry (buy some on dips within the entry range).

## Investment Thesis
1. Market leadership + distribution scale (100m+ customers) provides durable customer acquisition and cross-sell advantages that translate to high ROE and predictable earnings.
2. Diversified product mix (consumer, SME, mortgages, gold, housing subsidiary) lowers segment concentration risk while offering several growth levers for AUM and fee income.
3. Strong capital adequacy (CRAR ~21.9%) and a healthy liquidity buffer reduce execution risk and allow opportunistic funding/market actions.
4. Management’s proactive de-risking (wind-down of stressed captive books, tighter MSME underwriting) plus FinAI investments should reduce credit volatility and improve operating leverage over FY26–FY27.
5. Valuation is high but earnings growth + modest multiple expansion supports a 12‑month base-case upside of ~20%; investors should monitor credit-cost trajectories and funding spreads closely.
