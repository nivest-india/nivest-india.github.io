### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) |
| **Sector** | Banking |
| **Current Price** | ₹38.2 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹7,352 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-27 |

### Industry Overview

- PSU banking in India has seen sustained improvement in asset quality over the last 3 years driven by recoveries and higher provisioning coverage; banks are focusing on retail/MSME growth and improving operational efficiencies.  
- Credit growth in the system remains healthy; most PSU banks are guiding mid‑teens credit growth and looking to expand retail and MSME exposures to diversify risk.  
- Margin environment is mixed — deposit costs rose during rate tightening but improving liability mix (high CASA in some banks) helps offset interest cost pressure.  
- Consolidation, regulatory oversight and government support (where applicable) reduce tail‑risk for larger PSBs but limit free‑float driven re-ratings.  
- International exposure and treasury volatility remain incremental risk factors for banks with overseas branches.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Metric | IOB | PSU Median |
|--------|-----|------------|
| P/E | 19.3 | 7.3 |
| P/B | 2.18 | 1.02 |
| ROE% | 11.0 | 15.35 |
| Sales/Loan Growth (3yr) | ~19% | 18.8% |
| Int. Coverage | 1.30 | 1.31 |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Large addressable market and mid‑teens credit growth outlook for PSBs support structural demand for loans (+).  
- PSB asset quality cycle has largely bottomed; continuing recoveries and high PCR across PSBs reduce tail risk (+).  
- Margin pressure from higher deposit costs and competition remains a sector headwind (–).  
- Government ownership and regulatory support provide downside protection for PSBs but also limit sudden private‑sector re‑rating catalysts (neutral).  
- Index inclusions and global re‑jigs (occasional) can create episodic liquidity inflows but effect is stock‑specific (neutral).

#### Financial Strength: 7/10

| Metric | Value | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CRAR (capital adequacy) | 17.8% | Q1 FY25 |
| NIM | 3.06% | Q1 FY25 |
| Gross NPA | 1.97% | Jun 2025 |
| Net NPA | 0.32% | Jun 2025 |
| PCR | ~97% | Q1 FY25 |
| CASA | 42% | Q1 FY25 |
| Deposits | ₹311,939 Cr | Mar 2025 |
| Advances (approx.) | ₹~230,000 Cr | Q1 FY25 |
| Book value (BV) | ₹17.54 | Jun 2025 |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Asset quality: material improvement — gross NPA down to ~2.0% and net NPA ~0.32% with PCR ≈ 96–97% indicates clean‑up and lower near‑term credit volatility (+).  
- Capital: CRAR ~17.8% provides adequate buffer above regulatory minima and room for organic growth (+).  
- Profitability: Return on Equity ~11% is meaningful recovery vs prior years but still below best‑in‑class PSU peers (mixed).  
- Liability franchise: Deposits ~₹312k Cr and CASA ~42% provide stable funding; deposit growth supports asset expansion (+).  
- Liquidity / cash: cash equivalents and holdings are reasonable; however incremental borrowings rose in recent years — monitor funding mix (neutral/monitor).

#### Valuations: 4/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/E (TTM) | 19.3 |
| Price / BV | 2.18 |
| EV / EBITDA | 18.5 |
| EPS (TTM) | ₹2.00 |
| ROE | 11.0% |
| Peer median P/E | 7.3 |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- IOB trades at a material premium to PSU peer medians on both P/E (~19.3 vs 7.3) and P/B (2.18 vs 1.02), implying high expectations are priced in (negative).  
- Absolute multiple appears elevated relative to peers despite ROE that is still below median PSU ROE (~15%), creating valuation risk if earnings momentum slows (negative).  
- EV/EBITDA is also elevated vs median, lowering margin for error for negative surprises (negative).  
- Valuation premium is driven by visible earnings recovery, index/ETF flows potential and low free float — these are real but may not be sustainable without continued earnings beats (mixed).  
- Given high multiples, incremental earnings growth and sustained asset quality improvement are prerequisites for re-rating (conditional).

#### Growth Potential: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 3‑yr sales CAGR | ~19% |
| 3‑yr profit CAGR | ~25% |
| PAT (FY25) | ₹3,335 Cr |
| TTM PAT | ₹3,813 Cr |
| Management credit growth guide | 13–14% (FY25 outlook) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Strong historical growth: Revenue and PAT CAGRs over recent years are healthy (sales ~19% 3‑yr; profits ~25% 3‑yr) — demonstrates execution capability (+).  
- Loan book expansion (advances grown markedly since FY22) supports future NII growth; management guidance of mid‑teens credit growth is achievable (+).  
- Higher provisioning coverage and lower slippages mean incremental credit costs are likely to be modest, aiding profit conversion (+).  
- Growth is concentrated in agri/MSME/retail segments which have margin and risk trade‑offs; downside exists if agricultural or MSME stress re‑emerges (neutral/monitor).  
- Scale benefits and branch footprint (3,200+ branches) provide distribution advantage for granular pickup (positive).

#### Corporate Governance: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter (GOI) holding | 94.61% | Jun 2025 |
| Dividend history | No regular dividend since FY2018 |
| Past PCA status | Under PCA until 2021 (removed) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Government majority ownership (~94.6%) provides strong recapitalisation and policy support backstop (+ for solvency).  
- High promoter holding and limited public float constrain minority investor influence and reduce liquidity (negative).  
- Removal from PCA and prior recapitalisations demonstrate credible turnaround governance actions by authorities (+).  
- Dividend/non‑cash returns absent — management has prioritized balance sheet repair and growth, dampening income‑seeking investor appeal (neutral/negative).  
- Board/management continuity and recent hires appear stable; disclose and governance practices are standard for a large PSB but transparency and active investor engagement could improve (mixed).

#### Research Reports: 3/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Broker research coverage | Limited / few broker reports found |
| Recent broker reports | No broad broker coverage located in last 12 months |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Coverage by sell‑side analysts is limited relative to large peers; few published broker reports were available in the period reviewed (negative for discoverability).  
- Limited coverage increases information asymmetry and can amplify volatility when news or corporate actions occur (negative).  
- Media coverage of quarterly results and index inclusions was present (news outlets) and provided investor visibility (neutral).  
- Lack of consensus analyst targets reduces external validation of valuation assumptions (negative).  
- Investors should rely on company filings, concall disclosures and independent modeling until broker coverage expands (practical note).

#### Technical Analysis: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current price | ₹38.18 |
| 50‑DMA | ~₹38.04 |
| 200‑DMA | ~₹42.98 |
| RSI (14) | 56 |
| MACD | Slightly negative |
| Momentum score | Neutral (Trendlyne ~39.7) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Price is trading near the 50‑DMA but below the 200‑DMA — indicative of a medium‑term downtrend / consolidation after a large fall from the 52‑week high (neutral/negative).  
- Momentum oscillators (RSI ~56) are neutral; MACD just below center suggests lack of strong bullish impetus (neutral).  
- Large intraday and multi‑day volume spikes indicate episodic liquidity and trader-driven moves; low free float exacerbates price jumps (caution).  
- Technical levels: immediate resistance near ~₹38.6–39.0 and support in the mid‑30s; break below support would increase downside risk (actionable).  
- Overall technical outlook is neutral; tradeable on momentum and news, but not a clear trending buy.

#### Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Metric | Recent developments |
|--------|--------------------|
| Q1 FY26 reaction | Strong quarter (Jun 2025 PAT ₹1,111 Cr) — positive coverage |
| Index flows | Inclusion in certain global re‑jigs may create flows |
| Media coverage | Positive on turnaround and improved asset quality |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Recent quarterly results (Jun 2025) and improved asset‑quality datapoints have generated positive media sentiment and investor interest (+).  
- Inclusion in certain index re‑jigs (reported) and low free float can create outsized short‑term inflows when allocations occur (+ for spikes).  
- Institutional ownership (FIIs) remains negligible and DIIs are modest — limited long‑term anchor demand constrains sustained positive sentiment (negative).  
- Absence of dividends and still‑elevated relative valuation produce mixed retail sentiment — demand is event‑driven (neutral).  
- Market currently treats IOB as a turnaround/high‑beta PSU bank — sentiment will swing with quarterly beats/misses (volatile).

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 4/10

| Holder | Latest (Jun 2025) |
|--------|--------------------|
| Promoters (GOI) | 94.61% |
| FIIs | 0.08% |
| DIIs | 2.37% |
| Public / Others | 2.94% |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Extremely high promoter (GOI) stake (>94%) materially reduces free float and tradable supply — higher idiosyncratic volatility and low liquidity (negative).  
- FIIs are nearly absent, limiting a traditional channel for re‑rating through institutional accumulation (negative).  
- DII share has inched up but remains small; lack of strong institutional base reduces stability of flows (negative).  
- Public float concentrated among retail results in more headline‑driven price action (volatile).  
- Any capital raises by GOI or secondary issuance can materially change ownership and dilute/share price dynamics — watch for fund‑raising events.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| S.No. | Name | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE% |
|-------|------|--------------------:|----:|---------:|-----:|
| 1. | SBI | 745,695.44 | 9.39 | 1.39 | 17.2 |
| 2. | Bank of Baroda | 121,599.41 | 6.25 | 0.79 | 15.5 |
| 3. | Punjab National Bank | 118,112.98 | 7.10 | 0.86 | 15.2 |
| 4. | Union Bank of India | 98,984.96 | 5.26 | 0.87 | 17.1 |
| 5. | Canara Bank | 96,157.97 | 5.20 | 0.91 | 17.8 |
| 6. | Indian Bank | 88,347.37 | 7.70 | 1.24 | 17.1 |
| 7. | I O B | 7,352.00 | 19.28 | 2.18 | 11.0 |

Note: Peer medians show materially lower P/E and P/B versus IOB; IOB trades at a pronounced premium despite lower ROE vs several peers.

## Key Strengths
- Substantial improvement in asset quality: gross NPA ~1.97% and PCR ~96–97% (Jun 2025).  
- Adequate capital buffer: CRAR ~17.8% supports growth without immediate dilution.  
- Strong deposit franchise (₹312k Cr) and CASA ~42% providing stable funding.  
- Visible earnings momentum: TTM PAT ~₹3,813 Cr and consistent 3‑yr profit CAGR.  
- Government majority ownership provides sovereign backstop for capital and policy support.

## Key Concerns  
- Valuation premium vs PSU peer set (P/E ~19.3, P/B ~2.18) creates downside risk if growth disappoints.  
- Very small public float and minimal FII participation increase volatility and limit sustained institutional inflows.  
- No dividend policy since FY2018 — lower appeal to income investors.  
- Limited sell‑side coverage reduces independent validation and may increase information asymmetry.  
- Profitability (ROE ~11%) still trails better‑run PSU peers, requiring continued improvement to justify valuation.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹60 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Continued strong credit growth (above guidance), further margin recovery (NIM expansion), sustained low slippages and high PCR, index/ETF inflows on re‑rating and scarcity (low free float) causing multiple expansion to mid‑20s on the back of visible earnings recovery.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹43 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Moderate credit growth (12–14%), steady NIMs, continued containment of slippages and stable PCR; earnings growth ~10–15% and market keeps a modest premium but multiple normalizes slightly (~PE ~19), producing low‑double digit upside.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹26 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Earnings disappoint (slower loan growth / higher credit costs), multiple compresses toward single‑digit/low teens (peer re‑rating), higher borrowing costs or provisioning requirements, and absence of FII demand — results in significant downside.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|---------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic Case | ₹60 | +57% | Strong re‑rating on execution and multiple expansion |
| Realistic Case | ₹43 | +13% | Modest upside — limited re‑rating; earnings drive returns |
| Pessimistic Case | ₹26 | -32% | Earnings/multiple compression risk; downside protection weak |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**  
- **Primary Recommendation:** HOLD (Realistic scenario upside ~13% which falls in 0–15% range).  
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Valuation is rich relative to peers; while earnings and asset‑quality improvements reduce tail risk, upside at current price is modest and does not justify a fresh large long position. Key risks are multiple compression and unexpected credit stress.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target (Realistic) | Position Size | Time Horizon |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------:|----------:|--------------------:|--------------:|-------------:|
| HOLD | Core (selective accumulation on dips) | ₹30 — ₹36 | ₹26 | ₹43 (12 months) | Small to Medium (2–5% of portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**  
- Current market price incorporates a premium for a successful turnaround; given modest upside in the realistic case, avoid initiating a large new position at CMP.  
- Consider accumulation on meaningful dips (₹30–36) where upside/risk ratio improves; use stop loss to limit downside given low free float volatility.  
- Maintain a small‑to‑medium core position for exposure to PSU banking turnaround, but re‑assess upon quarterly outcomes and any capital‑raising announcements.  
- Monitor liquidity events (index inclusions, allotments) and changes in promoter dilution or FPO/righths which can change the thesis materially.

## Investment Thesis
1. IOB has materially repaired asset quality (gross NPA ~2% and PCR ~97%) and strengthened capital (CRAR ~17.8%), creating a structurally stronger balance sheet.  
2. The bank's deposit base and branch network provide scale to convert credit demand into NII growth; management targets mid‑teens credit growth which appears achievable.  
3. Earnings recovery is visible — TTM PAT ~₹3,813 Cr and stable NIMs have translated into improved ROE (~11%), but ROE still trails best PSU peers, limiting re‑rating unless ROE improves further.  
4. Valuation currently prices a high degree of success (P/E ~19.3, P/B ~2.18). Absent continued earnings beat and broader institutional interest, valuation downside exists.  
5. Recommendation is HOLD — accumulate selectively on dips with a disciplined stop loss; re‑rate only if consistent earnings beats, sustainable margin expansion and greater institutional participation materialize.
