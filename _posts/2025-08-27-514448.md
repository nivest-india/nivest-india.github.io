### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Jyoti Resins And Adhesives Ltd. (514448) |
| **Sector** | Chemical Manufacturing (Synthetic-resin adhesives) |
| **Current Price** | ₹1,277 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹1,533 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-27 |

### Industry Overview
- Indian wood‑adhesives (white‑glue) market remains fragmented with organized players gaining share; industry estimates place market size around ~₹3,000 Cr with an expected CAGR of 8–9% over the medium term.  
- Structural growth drivers: urbanisation, government housing initiatives (PMAY/Smart Cities), rising modular furniture and organised retail penetration.  
- Raw‑material linkage to VAM (vinyl acetate monomer) and petrochemical feedstocks creates cyclic cost volatility that flows through margins unless managed with inventory and pricing discipline.  
- Channel dynamics favour companies with deep distribution, trade loyalty programmes and strong brand recall — a structural advantage for scale incumbents.  
- Competitive landscape: Pidilite is the clear market leader; mid‑sized specialty players (Jyoti, BASF India, Atul, Vinati/chemicals players in adjacent segments) compete on price, product differentiation and distribution reach.

## Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market size (approx.) | ₹3,000 Cr |
| Expected CAGR (industry) | 8–9% |
| Jyoti market share (retail white‑glue) | ~5% (company disclosure) |
| Key tailwinds | Urbanisation, housing schemes, modular furniture |
| Key risks | VAM/raw‑material volatility, incumbents scaling marketing |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Large, resilient end‑market with diversified end‑uses (residential, commercial, furniture) supports durable demand and volume growth for adhesives.  
- Market is still fragmented — significant white‑space for share gains by a focused brand and distribution push.  
- Raw‑material exposure (import‑linked VAM) is a structural risk; companies with balance‑sheet strength and inventory/hedging practices are better positioned.  
- Distribution and trade (carpenter) networks are critical — Jyoti’s 12,000+ retailers and 3.5 lakh carpenter reach is a material moat.  
- Moderate threat from large FMCG/home‑improvement players entering the segment but their success depends on effective last‑mile distribution and trade incentives.

#### Financial Strength: 9/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (FY25) | ₹284 Cr |
| EBITDA (FY25) | ₹89.5 Cr |
| EBITDA margin (FY25) | 31.5% |
| PAT (FY25) | ₹73.9 Cr |
| EPS (FY25) | ₹61.57 |
| Cash & equivalents (Mar 2025) | ₹153 Cr |
| Debt / Equity | 0.00 |
| ROE | 37.4% |
| ROCE | 50.0% |
| Debtor days / Inventory days / CCC | 161 / 28 / 128 days |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Near‑zero financial leverage and a strong cash position (₹~153 Cr) materially reduce execution and liquidity risk — a key strength for funding growth and withstanding raw‑material spikes.  
- High ROE (~37%) and ROCE (~50%) indicate excellent capital efficiency and return profile compared with peers.  
- Margins are best‑in‑class (EBITDA ~31%) reflecting premium product mix, cost control and high asset turnover (asset turnover ~8x).  
- Positive operating cash flows and consistent free cash generation (FCF positive historically) support capex and generous dividends.  
- Key caution: high receivable days (161) and a long cash conversion cycle (128 days) increase working‑capital sensitivity — management must convert cash quickly as scale increases.

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/E (TTM / FY25) | ~21.1x |
| Price / Book Value | 6.69x |
| Book Value per share | ₹191 |
| EV / EBITDA | ~14.0x |
| Intrinsic value (tool estimate) | ₹2,121 |
| Median PE (market) | 22.2x |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Absolute multiples (P/E ~21x, EV/EBITDA ~14x) are reasonable relative to its historical growth and much lower than the sector leader (Pidilite) but higher than the median peer P/E — reflecting superior profitability.  
- Price / book (6.7x) looks elevated; however, high ROE and strong cash balances justify premium PBV vs commodity chemical players.  
- Valuation is a trade‑off: premium multiple vs peers is justified by ROE/ROCE and FCF profile, but downside exists if margins compress or execution lags.  
- Broker coverage (recent) supports a higher multiple if growth and margin targets are met (CD Research target ~₹1,764 -> implied FY27 multiple ~22x).  
- Reasonable mid‑term upside already priced in; incremental catalysts (capacity utilisation, market share gains) would justify multiple expansion.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Management volume CAGR target | 20–25% (FY24–FY27 guidance) |
| Current plant capacity | 2,000 TPM (24,000 TPA) |
| Utilisation | ~55% (company disclosed) |
| Planned capex | ₹30–35 Cr (FY26–FY27 plan) |
| Long‑term capacity aspiration | Applied for clearance to expand toward 60,000 TPA |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Clear, achievable growth levers: brown‑field capacity expansion, warehouse/logistics investments, and a national brand/marketing push.  
- Distribution scale (branches, distributors, 12k retailers) and trade loyalty program (carpenter reach) provide a platform for rapid volume uptake with limited incremental SG&A per unit.  
- Management targets (20–25% volume CAGR) are reasonable given current utilisation and planned incremental capacity funded from internal accruals (zero debt).  
- Execution risk exists: marketing/advertising intensity to gain share could compress margins transiently (already visible in Q1 FY26).  
- If the company ramps utilisation to >75–80% post capex, operating leverage should drive outsized EPS growth and ROIC.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding | 50.83% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.00% |
| Dividend policy (FY25) | ₹9 final; payout ~15% |
| Bonus history | 2:1 bonus (2022) |
| Related party / debt red flags | None material disclosed |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Stable promoter holding (>50%) with no pledging reduces governance red‑flag risk on leverage or forced selling.  
- Consistent shareholder returns (regular dividends, bonus in 2022) demonstrate shareholder‑friendly capital allocation.  
- Disclosure and investor presentations have been regular and detailed — positive governance signal.  
- Family‑run nature implies concentrated control; while alignment is strong, minority investors rely on transparency and board independence going forward.  
- No material contingent liabilities or related‑party issues flagged in the analyzed filings.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Report | Date | Broker View | Target |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| CD Equisearch (selected broker) | 08 Aug 2025 | BUY; growth via capacity expansion, brand push and premium mix | ₹1,764 (9–12 months) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent broker coverage (within past 12 months) is constructive — CD Equisearch’s BUY / ₹1,764 target is built on 22× FY27E EPS and a clear capacity + distribution thesis.  
- Research consensus (limited number of public broker reports) highlights the same catalysts: capacity utilisation, distribution reach and premium product mix.  
- Analysts flag key risks (VAM volatility, execution of brand campaign) clearly — coverage is balanced and actionable.  
- Limited number of sell‑side reports (small‑cap coverage) but the quality and depth of decks / investor presentations reviewed are strong.  
- Monitor updates to broker estimates as management executes advertising and capacity rollout (quarterly checks recommended).

#### Technical Analysis: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current price vs 50 DMA / 200 DMA | Trading below 50 DMA (~₹1,338) and 200 DMA (~₹1,340) |
| RSI (14) | 35.6 (near oversold territory) |
| MACD | Negative (bearish) |
| MA signals | Trading below 7/8 SMAs (short‑term weakness) |
| Momentum score | Neutral (Trendlyne momentum ~45) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short‑term technicals show the stock trading below key moving averages and negative MACD — indicating momentum is weak and near‑term risk exists.  
- Oscillators (RSI ~36) suggest the stock is close to oversold, which increases probability of a technical bounce rather than trend reversal.  
- Volume spikes on selective dates (recent large volumes) indicate episodic institutional / retail interest but not sustained accumulation yet.  
- For entry timing, wait for price to stabilise above 50 DMA with improving RSI/MACD crossovers for a lower risk entry.  
- Technicals do not negate the fundamental thesis but signal a need for staged buying and a clear stop‑loss discipline.

#### Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Indicator | Recent Signal |
|-----------|---------------|
| News flow | Positive — brand ambassador, Q4 results, dividend announcement |
| Earnings reaction | Mixed — revenue growth but margin compression in quarters with heavy ad spend |
| Analyst sentiment | Mostly constructive (BUY / Accumulate from select brokers) |
| Retail interest | Healthy — active public float and consistent trading volumes |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent corporate actions (national brand campaign with a celebrity, declared final dividend ₹9, and proactive investor presentations) have been taken positively by the market.  
- Short‑term sentiment dented by strategic advertising spend that compressed quarterly margins; market reaction has been cautious but not panicked.  
- Low FII presence and high promoter + domestic retail ownership means sentiment is driven more by domestic brokers and retail flows.  
- Institutional interest remains modest; any meaningful DII / FII buying would likely re-rate the stock.  
- Overall sentiment is constructive if management delivers on utilisation and visible payoff from marketing.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 7/10

| Holder Category | Latest (Jun 2025) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Promoters | 50.83% |
| FIIs | 0.08% |
| DIIs | 1.22% |
| Public / Others | 47.87% |
| No. of shareholders | 48,499 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High promoter stake (50.8%) ensures alignment but also concentrates control; no pledging is a positive.  
- FIIs presence is negligible — restricts the company from immediate large foreign inflows; however, low FII is common in niche midcaps.  
- DII holdings have inched up (yet remain small) — stable domestic institutional interest would be a positive monitorable.  
- Public shareholding includes several sizeable retail/co. holders (e.g., top public names ~6%–7% historically), indicating stable domestic ownership.  
- Overall pattern points to promoter control with strong retail/domestic public float; monitor any material block trades or sudden promoter selling.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Mar Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE % | EV/EBITDA |
|------|------------------|-----:|---------:|------:|----------:|
| Pidilite Inds. | 157,707.76 | 71.7 | 16.17 | 23.1 | 46.2 |
| Gujarat Fluorochem | 37,134.79 | 59.7 | 5.12 | 8.3 | 29.7 |
| Deepak Nitrite | 25,145.42 | 41.4 | 4.67 | 13.4 | 24.5 |
| Atul | 18,433.48 | 36.9 | 3.29 | 9.1 | 17.6 |
| BASF India | 19,391.53 | 47.1 | 5.30 | 13.7 | 25.5 |
| Vinati Organics | 17,766.22 | 40.2 | 6.33 | 15.8 | 26.7 |
| Jyoti Resins (514448) | 1,533.70 | 21.1 | 6.69 | 37.4 | 14.0 |

- Jyoti trades at a substantially lower P/E than larger branded peer Pidilite but carries a higher PBV because of strong ROE and a high cash balance. EV/EBITDA is moderate relative to peers given the company’s smaller scale.

## Key Strengths
- Debt‑free balance sheet with large cash reserves (~₹153 Cr) — supports capex, dividends and buffers raw‑material shocks.  
- High profitability (EBITDA margin ~31.5%) and exceptional capital efficiency (ROCE ~50%, ROE ~37%).  
- Large and sticky distribution + trade ecosystem (12k retailers, 3.5 lakh carpenters) — meaningful moat for retail penetration.  
- Clear growth roadmap and management guidance (20–25% volume CAGR; warehouse + brown‑field expansion funded internally).  
- Consistent shareholder returns (dividend history, 2:1 bonus in 2022) and transparent investor communications.

## Key Concerns  
- High debtor days (161) and long cash conversion cycle (128 days) — working‑capital management must improve with scale.  
- Raw‑material (VAM) is import‑linked and volatile — sudden spikes can compress margins if pricing pass‑through is delayed.  
- Execution risk on capacity ramp and national brand campaign — advertising can compress margins before volume payoff.  
- Limited FII presence — re‑rating depends on larger institutional interest which is not yet visible.  
- Elevated PBV vs peers — valuation can derate if growth or margin momentum stalls.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹2,121 (18 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Full success of brand campaign + rapid market share gains, utilisation rising to ~85% after brown‑field capex, FY27–FY28 EPS expansion (EPS > ₹90) and multiple expansion to 23–25× driven by visible growth and greater institutional interest. Management meets/exceeds 20–25% volume CAGR and raw‑material environment remains benign.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,764 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management achieves guided volume CAGR (20%+), incremental capacity funded internally, EBITDA margins normalise ~30–32% after advertising normalisation. Broker consensus target (~22× FY27E EPS) supports this price (CD Equisearch target used as primary reference). Realistic upside ~+38% vs CMP.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹950 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Raw‑material cost spike (VAM) + aggressive competitive pricing lead to margin compression to mid‑20s; advertising spends do not convert to volume gains; multiple compresses to ~10–12× due to lower visibility. Resulting downside ~‑26% vs CMP.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹2,121 | +66% | Strong execution + multiple expansion; high reward but execution dependent |
| Realistic | ₹1,764 | +38% | Balances growth and margin normalisation — primary case; supports BUY |
| Pessimistic | ₹950 | -26% | Execution / margin risk material; downside if raw materials spike or spend fails |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (based on realistic scenario showing ≥15% upside).  
- **Risk‑Reward Assessment:** Upside (realistic) ~+38% vs downside in pessimistic scenario ~‑26% — asymmetric but execution dependent. Core thesis supported by debt‑free balance sheet, high margins and clear growth levers; downside driven by working‑capital and raw‑material shocks.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price (realistic) | Position Size | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------|---------------|----------|
| BUY | Core accumulation (medium term) | ₹1,150 – ₹1,350 | ₹1,050 (≈‑18%) | ₹1,764 (12 months) | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) | 9–12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Strong fundamentals (debt‑free, high ROE/ROCE, healthy FCF) and visible growth levers justify accumulation at current levels.  
- Use staged buy on dips to average in (given short‑term technical weakness). Entry band recommended to manage risk.  
- Stop loss set to protect capital if execution or demand fails materially; position sizing moderate to balance risk/reward.

## Investment Thesis
1. Jyoti is a niche, high‑margin player in a structurally growing adhesives market — the combination of premium product mix and distribution reach drives sustainable profitability.  
2. Debt‑free balance sheet and large cash reserves enable self‑funded capacity expansion and dividend continuity without dilution or refinancing risk.  
3. Management’s 20–25% volume CAGR target is credible given low utilisation today (55%) and planned brown‑field expansions + warehouse/logistics investments.  
4. Valuation offers a favourable risk/reward: realistic scenario implies ~+38% upside to broker‑supported targets while downside is manageable if SP retains earnings power.  
5. Key monitoring items: working‑capital (receivable days), raw‑material price trends (VAM), margin trajectory as advertising spend normalises, and progress on capacity utilisation.
