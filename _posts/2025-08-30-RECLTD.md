### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | REC Limited (RECLTD) |
| **Sector** | Infrastructure Finance (Power & Renewable) |
| **Current Price** | ₹350 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹92,163 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- India’s power & infrastructure financing opportunity is large and policy-driven: continuing distribution capex (RDSS/DBT/PM Surya Ghar), transmission and renewable pipelines support multi-year demand for project finance.
- Renewable-energy transition is a key structural tailwind (India target ~450 GW by 2030) — lenders with green‑finance capability and access to low‑cost international capital (green bonds) stand to benefit.
- Distribution sector reforms (RDSS, RBPF) are improving DISCOM cashflows and reducing AT&C losses (management notes AT&C ~16.3% in recent updates), making distribution financing less risky over time.
- Competitive set: state‑backed financiers (Power Finance Corp, IRFC) plus large banks and NBFCs are competing for the same mandates; scale + sovereign linkage remain competitive advantages.
- Funding markets: access to tax‑exempt bonds, domestic institutional bonds and ECBs (hedged) is a differentiator—cost of funds and hedging strategy materially affect margins for NBFC lenders.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Power/infrastructure capex (near-term pipeline) | ~₹12,00,000 Cr (company investor materials / industry guidance) |
| India renewable target (2030) | 450 GW |
| Distribution share of REC disbursements (FY25) | ~53% of disbursements |
| RDSS / Government schemes | Active role — REC is a nodal agency for multiple schemes |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong policy tailwinds: REC is strategically positioned as a government‑linked lender for RDSS, rooftop solar and other programmes — this drives a reliable pipeline of sanctioned projects.
- Large addressable market: renewable and distribution capex programs create sustained multi-year demand for project finance; REC has privileged access via Maharatna / nodal roles.
- Competitive pressure: banks and other NBFCs are active in RE and infra finance; however REC’s sector focus and long relationships provide a durable advantage.
- Implementation risks concentrated at state level: execution and PPA delays in some projects can temporarily slow disbursements; still, reform momentum reduces long-term risk.
- Funding advantage: diversified funding mix (domestic institutional, 54EC, ECBs, green bonds) keeps REC’s cost of funds competitive vs peers.

#### Financial Strength: 9/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Outstanding loan book (Jun 2025) | ₹5,84,568 Cr |
| Net Profit (TTM) | ₹16,890 Cr |
| ROE (Last) | 21.5% |
| Capital Adequacy (Q1 FY26) | 23.98% |
| Gross NPA / Net NPA (latest) | ~1.05% / 0.24% (post-resolution) |
| Debt / Equity | 6.33x |
| Book Value / share | ~₹298 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong profitability and returns: ROE >20% and consistent PAT growth (FY25 PAT ~₹15,713 Cr) demonstrate robust earnings generation for a leveraged infrastructure lender.
- Conservative capitalisation: CAR (~24% in Q1 FY26; FY25 ~26%) provides ample headroom for balance‑sheet growth and absorption of shocks.
- Asset quality improving: net credit‑impaired assets are low and provision coverage is robust (~70–80%+ on remaining stressed exposures), reflecting conservative provisioning and active resolution.
- Diversified and competitive funding: multi‑currency ECBs (fully hedged), domestic institutional bonds and tax‑exempt instruments nurture cost efficiency and liquidity.
- Leverage is high by corporate standards (Debt/Equity ~6.3x) — intrinsic to the business model — but credit ratings (AAA domestic / investment grade international) and strong coverage mitigate refinancing risk.

#### Valuations: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/E (TTM) | ~5.5x |
| Price / Book Value | ~1.18x |
| EV / EBITDA | ~10.4x |
| Dividend yield | ~5.1% |
| Median PE (historic/peer) | ~7.2x (median reference) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Deep value on earnings: P/E ~5–6x vs many peers materially higher; REC trades at a significant discount to broader NBFC/infra financing universe.
- Reasonable P/B: P/B ~1.2x vs historical medians and peers — combined with rising book value gives margin of safety.
- Dividend yield adds to total return: FY25 dividend policy delivered a high cash yield (FY25 total dividend ₹18/share) — helps downside protection.
- Valuation linked to provision reversals and loan‑book growth: near-term upside largely contingent on expected provision reversals and sustaining spreads; hence multiple expansion is plausible but not guaranteed.
- Relative to peers (PFC, IRFC), REC is attractively priced on P/E/P/B with comparable ROE — supports a valuation upside thesis.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY25 disbursements | ~₹1,91,000 Cr (FY25 disclosures) |
| Q1 FY26 disbursements | ₹59,508 Cr (record quarter) |
| Loan-book growth guidance | Management: ~12% loan‑book growth (FY26 target) |
| RE disbursement growth | Renewable disbursements +35–63% YoY in recent quarters |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Multiple growth levers: distribution capex, renewables, transmission and a growing infra & logistics mandate (up to 33%) support medium‑term loan‑book expansion.
- Proven execution: record disbursements (Q1 FY26) and a pipeline of sanctioned projects support revenue visibility.
- Renewable acceleration: RE share is rising materially and management aims at a meaningful scale-up — higher-yielding RE loans help margins.
- Prepayment / run‑off risk: high prepayments (run‑off) reduce headline AUM growth but reflect borrower dynamics; management expects this and factors it into guidance.
- Growth is capital‑intensive but supported by CAR and access to diversified funding — execution and PPA sign-offs remain gating factors.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter | Power Finance Corporation (PFC) – 52.63% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.00% |
| Recent management change | CMD appointed Apr 22, 2025 (Jitendra Srivastava) |
| Dividend policy | Consistent high payout; FY25 total ₹18/share |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong public‑sector promoter with stable long‑term ownership (PFC 52.63%) — provides de‑facto policy alignment and funding credibility.
- Transparent capital allocation: consistent and generous dividend policy shows shareholder-friendly capital return; recent board actions (market borrowing programmes, strategic subsidiaries) follow clear strategy.
- Institutional oversight and ratings discipline: AAA domestic ratings and regular audited disclosures and investor presentations; good disclosure on stressed assets and provisioning.
- Leadership continuity: seasoned management with a recent CMD appointment (career civil service/sector background) — transition appears orderly.
- Governance risk remains limited: minimal promoter pledging, clear board oversight; watch for future related-party transactions and subsidiary carve‑outs as REC expands into infra/logistics.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Broker | Date | Recommendation / TP |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Motilal Oswal | 31 Jul 2025 | BUY — TP ₹460 |
| ICICI Securities | 25 Jul 2025 | BUY — TP ₹540 |
| Emkay Global | 15 May 2025 | BUY — TP ₹525 |
| Motilal / earlier notes | Feb 2025 | BUY — TP ₹550 (historical) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong analyst coverage: multiple reputable brokers (Motilal, ICICI, Emkay) have BUY calls with 12‑18 month targets in the ₹460–₹600 range, reflecting broad comfort with earnings and asset quality trends.
- Consistent thesis across reports: valuation gap, provision reversals, NIM stability and high dividend support the buy case.
- Catalysts identified by brokers: NPA resolutions, renewables traction, capital adequacy and dividend continuation.
- Dependence on execution: broker upside is conditional on loan‑book growth and spreads; a missed guidance would prompt revisions.
- Research depth: brokers provide multiple valuation approaches (P/B, P/E anchored to FY26/FY27) — convergent buy recommendations add conviction.

#### Technical Analysis: 4/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 1‑year price performance | -44% |
| Current relation to 50 / 200 DMA | Trading below both 50 DMA (~₹389) and 200 DMA (~₹425) |
| RSI (14) | ~22 (oversold) |
| SMA/EMA signals | Below 8/8 SMAs and EMAs (bearish) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short‑term technicals are weak: price has fallen materially from 52‑week highs and trades below key moving averages — momentum indicators are negative.
- Oscillators show oversold conditions (RSI ~22) which could set up a mean‑reversion bounce, but that is a short‑term technical signal rather than fundamental improvement.
- Volume profile: reasonably high trading volumes on declines indicate conviction selling at higher levels; caution for momentum traders.
- Longer‑term trend still positive historically (multi‑year returns strong), but current technical structure favors wait/accumulate on weakness rather than chase.
- Technical weakness increases timing risk for new entrants; recommended staggered buying / accumulation rather than full allocation at once.

#### Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Metric | Recent development |
|--------|--------------------|
| Q1 FY26 reaction | Record disbursements (₹59,508 Cr), PAT ₹4,451 Cr, interim dividend ₹4.60/sh |
| Ratings | Domestic AAA maintained; international ratings investment grade (Moody’s Baa3 / Fitch BBB-) |
| News flow | Multiple positive investor presentations and strategic JV announcements; green bond market access |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent corporate newsflow is positive: record disbursements, improving asset quality, continued high dividend payouts and strong capital positions are supportive.
- Market has been cautious: sharp correction from 52W highs indicates investor concern over run‑off/prepayments, short‑term loan growth and possible margin pressure from competition.
- Broker coverage and rating agency affirmations support sentiment at institutional levels.
- Retail/institutional flows: FIIs and mutual funds remain significant holders; any sizable exit/entry would materially affect price — monitoring flows important.
- Overall sentiment is constructive but mixed — fundamental positives tempered by near‑term execution/valuation adjustments.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 9/10

| Holder | Latest % |
|--------|----------|
| Promoter (PFC) | 52.63% |
| FIIs / FPIs | ~19–21% |
| DIIs (Mutual funds, insurers) | ~14–15% |
| Public / Retail | ~12–13% |
| No. of shareholders | ~11.3 Lakh (Jun 2025) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High and stable promoter ownership (PFC 52.63%) — reduces risk of hostile actions and provides policy/market access.
- Strong institutional ownership (FIIs ~19–21%, DIIs ~15%) indicates confidence among large investors and provides liquidity stability.
- No promoter pledge and negligible related-party red flags — governance and promoter skin in the game are positive.
- Recent incremental DII interest (mutual funds, LIC) and continued FII allocation are constructive for secondary market stability.
- Large retail base provides dispersion of holdings; watch for any concentrated exits from marquee FIIs but current pattern is healthy.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Peer | Market Cap (₹Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE% |
|------|------------------|-----:|---------:|-----:|
| Power Finance Corp (PFC) | ₹1,25,305 Cr | 5.15 | 1.06 | 21.0% |
| IRFC | ₹1,54,352 Cr | 23.14 | 2.84 | 12.8% |
| HUDCO | ₹40,937 Cr | 14.72 | 2.28 | 15.7% |
| REC Ltd (RECLTD) | ₹92,163 Cr | 5.46 | 1.18 | 21.5% |

- REC’s absolute ROE is among the strongest; valuation (P/E, P/B) is lower than many peers, making REC attractive on a relative basis, especially given the higher dividend yield and AAA domestic rating.

## Key Strengths
- Strategic, government‑aligned franchise in power/distribution lending with Maharatna status and nodal agency roles.
- Strong profitability (ROE >20%), improving asset quality and healthy provision coverage.
- Diversified and cost‑efficient funding (domestic institutional, 54EC, ECBs, green bonds) — supports margin resilience.
- Rapid scale-up in renewable financing and an expanding infra & logistics mandate provide multi-year growth runway.
- Consistent high dividend payout policy adds investor return stability.

## Key Concerns  
- High leverage (intrinsic to business), dependence on wholesale funding markets — a tightening in credit markets could raise funding cost.
- Prepayment/run‑off dynamics reduce headline loan‑book growth despite robust disbursements; sustained high prepayments may compress future NII.
- Execution risk in expanding infra & logistics verticals and dependence on PPA/tariff finalisation for some projects.
- Market has priced concerns: share price correction has been steep and technical momentum is weak in the short term.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹600  
**Key Drivers:**  
- Loan-book growth re-accelerates to 13–15% driven by distribution & renewables; disbursements remain robust (FY26 disbursements ₹2.0–2.1 Lakh Cr).  
- Provision reversals and recoveries (₹700–1,000 Cr per quarter) materially improve reported PAT; net NPA approaches zero.  
- NIM stabilize/expand modestly to ~3.75–3.9% as yield on newer RE + infra loans offset funding cost; ROE remains >20%.  
- Market assigns higher P/B multiple (≈1.8–2.0x) as execution and asset quality visibly improve and dividend yield remains attractive.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹525  
**Key Drivers:**  
- Management delivers guided loan-book growth (~12% FY26), NIM around 3.5–3.75% and gradual resolution of stressed assets (modest provision write‑backs).  
- Dividend policy remains high (~30% payout) and capital adequacy remains >23% enabling measured growth.  
- Valuation re-rates toward mid‑peer multiples (P/B ~1.3–1.6x) as uncertainty around prepayments and credit tail risks recede.  
- Consensus broker TPs (₹460–₹540) cluster around this band — TP reflects conservative median of broker and intrinsic re‑rating scenarios.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹280  
**Key Drivers:**  
- Loan‑book growth disappoints (sub‑5–8% YoY) because of sustained prepayments and delayed PPA sign-offs; headline AUM stagnates.  
- New problem exposures or delayed NCLT resolutions force incremental provisioning (material provisioning hit), compressing PAT and reducing dividend capacity.  
- Margin compression due to intensified competition or rising funding costs (loss of favourable ECB/green bond access); market applies lower P/B (≈0.8–1.0x) to the stock.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP (₹350) | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|---------------------:|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹600 | +71% | Strong execution + multiple expansion |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹525 | +50% | Delivery of guidance, modest re‑rating — primary base case |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹280 | -20% | Execution shortfall, higher provisions, margin squeeze |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (based on realistic scenario showing +50% upside from current price)  
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Upside is substantial vs limited downside in base case due to conservative provisioning, AAA domestic rating and high dividend yield. Pessimistic outcome (-20%) is possible under severe execution/regulatory stress — position sizing and stop loss recommended.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price (12 months) | Position Size (portfolio) | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------:|---------------------------:|---------:|
| BUY | Core income + growth (Accumulate on weakness) | ₹320 — ₹370 | ₹300 | ₹525 | Medium: 2–5% (scale to 5% if conviction increases) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Valuation is attractive (P/E ~5.5x, P/B ~1.2x) with a high dividend yield (~5%) offering immediate income while upside accrues via book value growth and multiple re-rating.  
- Operational indicators (record disbursements, improving asset quality, AAA domestic rating) lower downside risk and support sustainable returns.  
- Key monitorables: loan-book growth vs prepayments, NIM/spread stability, pace of resolution of remaining stressed assets, and funding cost trajectory.  
- Technical weakness argues for staged buying (average-in) rather than a large one-time allocation.

## Investment Thesis
1. REC is the strategically positioned, government‑linked lender to India’s power value chain — privileged access to large distribution / RE programmes provides durable demand for financing.  
2. Strong profitability (ROE ~21%), high capital adequacy and improving asset quality underpin a low default profile relative to private peers.  
3. Valuation is compelling: low P/E and reasonable P/B combined with a 4–6% dividend yield create attractive risk‑adjusted return potential.  
4. Scale of renewable pipeline and REC’s proven access to low‑cost green bonds and ECBs support margin stability and long‑term growth.  
5. Main risks (prepayment-driven AUM volatility, funding market shocks, occasional project execution delays) are identifiable and actively managed — they can be monitored via quarterly disbursement and provisioning trends.
