### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Nazara Technologies (NAZARA) |
| **Sector** | Gaming & Interactive Entertainment |
| **Current Price** | ₹1,157 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹10,716 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-24 |

### Industry Overview

- Global gaming market remains large and structurally growing (management materials cite ~US$300bn by 2026); secular consumption shift to mobile, PC/console, and streaming supports long-term addressable market expansion.  
- India is an attractive high-growth market for gaming, ed‑tech and esports (company presentations cite an Indian TAM in the multi‑trillion‑rupee range over the next 3–5 years).  
- Key sector tailwinds: rising smartphone penetration, higher discretionary spends among younger cohorts, ad‑tech monetisation, increasing IP licensing and franchising revenue streams.  
- Sector headwinds: platform dependency (Apple/Google payment flows), regulatory risk (real‑money gaming / advertising restrictions), and event/content cycle volatility.  
- Competitive landscape: large global publishers and emerging Indian players increase competition for talent, IP and UA (user acquisition) budgets — differentiation via owned IP and cross‑platform publishing is critical.

## Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | India: high double‑digits (≈15–20% p.a.); Global: >10% p.a. |
| Market Size | Global ~US$300bn (by 2026 referenced in presentations); India multi‑trillion‑rupee TAM over 3–5 years |
| Sector Tailwinds | IP monetisation, subscription growth (kids/ed‑tech), ad‑tech data monetisation, global publishing opportunities |
| Sector Headwinds | Regulatory risk (RMG & advertising), platform fee uncertainty, UA cost inflation |
| Policy Support | Neutral–mixed (no direct industry stimulus; regulation is tightening for RMG) |
| Competition Level | High |
| Technology Disruption | Positive (AI for content, live ops, cross‑platform publishing) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Large total addressable market with secular tailwinds for IP‑led and subscription businesses.  
- Strong monetisation levers (IAP, subscriptions, ad‑tech, sponsorships) across segments.  
- Material regulatory risk to RMG and advertising that increases sector volatility.  
- Nazara’s multi‑vertical footprint positions it to capture secular tailwinds if execution and integration succeed.

#### Financial Strength: 6/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Debt-to-Equity | 0.08 | <1.5 (Good) |
| Interest Coverage | 6.75x | >2.5x (Good) |
| Free Cash Flow | -₹82.21 Cr (recent reported FCF figure) | Positive (Good) |
| Current Ratio | 1.63 | >1.2 (Good) |
| Quick Ratio | 1.63 | >1.0 (Good) |
| Net Debt | -₹239 Cr (Net cash: Cash ₹458 Cr - Borrowings ₹219 Cr at Mar‑2025) | Lower is better |
| Cash & Equivalents | ₹458 Cr (Mar‑2025) | Higher is better |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Conservative leverage (low debt) and healthy interest coverage provide flexibility for M&A and working capital.  
- Cash resources reduced after a heavy acquisition phase but net cash remains positive (net cash ~₹239 Cr at Mar‑2025).  
- Free cash flow has been seasonally and transactionally negative (acquisitions and working capital), which is a caution for valuation support.  
- Elevated debtor days / cash conversion cycle (Debtor days ~129) indicate working capital pressures in recent periods.  
- Overall balance‑sheet looks manageable but acquisitions have consumed cash and diluted cash cushions; monitor post‑acquisition OCF conversion.

#### Valuations: 3/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg | Historical Avg |
|-------------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| P/E Ratio | 86.5x | ~80x (peer sample median) | Elevated |
| P/B Ratio | 3.54x | 4.0x (median PBV from chart) | In premium zone |
| EV/EBITDA | 40.9x | High vs typical digital media peers (12–25x) | Elevated |
| Market Cap/Sales | ~6.6x (implied) | Premium | Elevated |
| PEG / EV/Sales | High | Premium vs peers | Elevated |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Nazara trades at a material premium on P/E and EV/EBITDA despite low trailing ROE/ROCE (~3–5%).  
- Valuation implies high expectations for rapid margin expansion and successful integration of multiple acquisitions.  
- Given recent regulatory noise, multiples look stretched relative to execution risk; valuation is the principal downside risk.

#### Growth Potential: 7/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 3.58% |
| ROCE | 3.02% |
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | ~38% |
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | ~46% |
| FY25 Revenue | ₹1,624 Cr |
| FY25 EBITDA | ₹153.5 Cr (FY25 reported) |
| CAPEX / Planned Investment | Management indicated FY26 CAPEX guidance ~₹150–200 Cr (presentations) |
| Dividend Payout | 0% (reinvestment focus) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Historically strong top‑line growth (high single/low double‑digit CAGR) driven by acquisitions and organic expansion.  
- Clear growth levers: owned IP (Kiddopia, WCC, Curve/Fusebox IP), global publishing (Curve), ad‑tech (Datawrkz/Space & Time) and offline expansion (Smaaash/Funky Monkeys).  
- Growth is acquisition‑heavy — scale needs integration to translate into sustainable ROCE/ROE improvement.  
- Management guidance and Q1 FY26 results show strong near‑term topline momentum; execution risk is the key uncertainty.

#### Corporate Governance: 6/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | Regular (quarterly + detailed investor presentations) |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Moderate‑High |
| Management Communication | Transparent on strategy; candid about failures and impairments |
| Governance Score | Mixed (active capital raises & preferential allotments) |
| Transparency Rating | Medium |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | 0.00% |
| Dividend History | Nil recent |
| Recent Buyback | None |
| Capital Allocation (FY24–FY25) | Large equity raises, multiple preferential allotments, major M&A (Curve, Fusebox, Smaaash, Moonshine exposure) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Management is accessible and provides detailed disclosures (concalls, presentations).  
- Execution track record shows both successes (Kiddopia scale, Fusebox/Curve accretion) and visible missteps (impairments, event cancellations).  
- Frequent preferential allotments and multiple raises dilute existing holders and reduce promoter skin‑in‑the‑game (promoter stake now ~8–9%) — governance mixed but not a red‑flag.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Average Target Price (selected broker coverage, pre‑regulatory shock) | ~₹1,080–1,185 |
| Current Price | ₹1,157 |
| Upside/Downside vs Avg TP | Mixed |
| Buy/Hold Recommendations | Majority were Buy/Hold prior to regulatory bill |
| Consensus Rating | Mixed (Buy / Hold) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Multiple brokers published bullish TPs earlier in 2025 reflecting growth & M&A upside.  
- Analysts’ valuation frameworks vary (SOTP, EV/EBITDA, growth multiples); consensus tended to assume successful integration and margin expansion.  
- Research coverage is active and broad; after the regulatory announcement, consensus will likely re‑price.

#### Technical Analysis & Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Period | Return | vs Nifty |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 Month | -18.2% | Underperformed (regulatory shock) |
| 3 Month | -11.1% | Underperformed |
| 6 Month | +25.6% | Outperformed YTD pre‑shock |
| 1 Year | +23.9% | Outperformed |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| RSI | Neutral–Moderate (technical momentum weakened after Aug bill) |
| 50‑DMA | ~₹1,325 (50 DMA) |
| 200‑DMA | ~₹1,143 (200 DMA) |
| Volume Trend | Spikes around news/corporate actions; recent high volumes with sell‑off |

| Market Sentiment & Near-term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| News Sentiment | Recently Negative (Online Gaming Bill / investor exits) |
| Social Media Buzz | Elevated around regulatory news |
| Options Activity | Not integrated in dataset, but volumes spiked on news |
| Upcoming Events | Nodwin deconsolidation EGM (Aug 13 approval period); follow‑up corporate filings; regulator statements |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Price momentum was strong earlier in 2025 (May–Jul), but the introduction/pass of the Online Gaming Bill and subsequent investor exits created short‑term negative sentiment and high volatility.  
- Technically price sits below 50‑DMA and modestly above 200‑DMA — indicating short‑term weakness but medium‑term support.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % (Jun‑2025) | Previous % (Mar‑2025) | Change |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| Promoter Holding | 8.30% | 8.78% | -0.48% |
| FII Holding | 12.98% | 13.04% | -0.06% |
| DII Holding | 9.80% | 12.44% | -2.64% |
| Public Holding | 68.90% | 65.74% | +3.16% |
| Pledged Shares | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | Presence of large institutional names (SBI MF, Think Investments, Plutus Wealth, notable HNIs) |
| Recent Changes | High‑profile exits noted (estate of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala sold earlier) |
| Promoter Skin | Low (promoter stake <10%) — reduces alignment with minority holders |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Institutional presence is strong (FIIs/DIIs), but promoter holding is low and has been diluted via preferential allotments.  
- No promoter pledging — positive. Large investor exits around regulatory risk increase short‑term headline risk.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | Premium | Nazara trades at much higher EV/EBITDA and P/E vs typical digital media / gaming peers — pricing relies on high expected growth and margin expansion. |
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Comparable to superior (pre‑shock) | Revenue growth is superior historically; ROE and ROCE lag peers due to acquisitions and amortisation; stock performance outperformed in 6‑12 month prior to regulatory shock. |

## Key Strengths
- Diversified portfolio across high‑growth subsegments: IP‑led games, kids ed‑tech (Kiddopia), ad‑tech (Datawrkz/Space & Time), esports/media.  
- Ownership of valuable IPs and growing publishing capability (Curve Games, Fusebox).  
- Low reported leverage and a history of being able to raise equity for strategic M&A.  
- Management visibility and detailed investor communications (frequent concalls/presentations).  
- Clear path to scale core gaming EBITDA margins (management has outlined targets).

## Key Concerns  
- Valuation is rich relative to current profitability (very high P/E and EV/EBITDA).  
- Regulatory risk — Online Gaming Bill (2025) introduces uncertainty for real‑money gaming and advertising, and has already compressed sentiment.  
- Execution & integration risk from multiple, large acquisitions and offline roll‑outs (Smaaash, Funky Monkeys).  
- Low promoter stake and repeated equity issuance raise governance/ownership alignment questions.  
- Working capital and FCF volatility due to M&A, high debtor days and inventory items.

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Consolidated revenue growth +35–45% YoY; EBITDA margin expands to ~14–18% (core gaming scales to 24–30% and offsets lower‑margin assets); successful integration of Curve/Fusebox/Kiddopia; Moonshine exposure resolved with minimal impairment; ad‑tech monetisation sustains. |
| **Catalysts** | Continued successful IP launches (Fusebox / Curve titles), double down on UA efficiency, ad‑tech revenue normalises up, favourable platform policy developments (alternative payment flows), margin expansion and multiple re‑rating. |
| **Valuation Assumption** | FY26E EBITDA ~₹350 Cr; re‑rating to EV/EBITDA ~50x on improved earnings visibility. |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,900 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Justification** | High upside scenario driven by both earnings growth and multiple expansion; probability limited by regulatory and integration risk. |

### Base Case (Most Likely) Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Revenue growth +20–30% YoY; consolidated EBITDA margin improves to ~10–12% (core gaming strong; other segments steady); Moonshine impact contained (associate / partial impairment) and Nodwin deconsolidation proceeds; no large incremental regulatory penalties but advertising constraints persist. |
| **Execution Milestones** | Successful early monetisation from newly acquired IPs, stabilising UA costs, conversion of acquired studios to positive contribution, completion of Nodwin deconsolidation. |
| **Valuation Assumption** | FY26E EBITDA ~₹260 Cr; EV/EBITDA ~48x (given market’s high multiple tolerance for growth). |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,350 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 55% |
| **Justification** | Most likely given Nazara’s diversified revenue base, proven IP monetisation capability and management guidance — tempered by regulatory noise that reduces probability of a clean bull re‑rating. |

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Regulation materially restricts RMG and related advertising; Moonshine / PokerBaazi faces curtailed operations and large write‑downs; event cancellations and ad‑tech headwinds persist; acquisitions fail to integrate; consolidated revenue falls or stagnates; EBITDA compresses to low levels. |
| **Risk Factors** | Online Gaming Bill enforcement tightens payments & ads; large impairment on associate investments; investor confidence erosion; multiple compression as growth narrative weakens. |
| **Valuation Assumption** | FY26E EBITDA falls to ~₹150 Cr; market applies a sharply lower multiple (EV/EBITDA ~20–25x). |
| **Target Price** | ₹700 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 25% |
| **Justification** | Regulatory passage and enforcement create real downside to value of RMG exposure and to investor sentiment; plausible given the recent bill and market reaction.

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bull Case** | +64.2% | ₹1,900 | 20% | +12.84% |
| **Base Case** | +16.7% | ₹1,350 | 55% | +9.18% |
| **Bear Case** | -39.5% | ₹700 | 25% | -9.88% |
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+12.14%** |

Probability‑weighted expected return calculation:  
0.20 × (+64.2%) + 0.55 × (+16.7%) + 0.25 × (‑39.5%) = +12.14% over 12 months (implied expected return vs current price ₹1,157).

Most Likely Scenario: Base Case — Evidence: recent Q1 FY26 operational momentum (revenue/EBITDA growth), management guidance and multiple accretive IP acquisitions support continued earnings growth, but regulatory headwinds (Online Gaming Bill) and investor exits make the bull re‑rating less likely in the near term.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | HOLD |
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered approach: Hold existing exposure; accumulate selectively on confirmed weakness and clearer regulatory resolution |
| **Entry Price Range** | Buy on dips: ₹900 – ₹1,050 (selective accumulation) |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹700 (for new purchases; adjust for individual risk tolerance) |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,350 (12 months) |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) — given execution and regulatory risk |
| **Timeline** | 12 months (monitor key catalysts) |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**  
1. Probability‑weighted expected return (~+12%) sits in the HOLD band (≥10% expected return) per the investment policy.  
2. Business fundamentals (IP portfolio, global publishing capability, diversified revenue mix) are attractive for medium‑term growth, but elevated valuation and recent regulatory developments increase downside risk.  
3. Regulatory clarity on the Online Gaming Bill, Moonshine / PokerBaazi outcomes and evidence of sustained margin expansion are required to move to a BUY.  
4. For risk‑tolerant investors who accept regulatory uncertainty, selective accumulation on dips is reasonable; for conservative investors, wait for clearer de‑risking (associate impairment clarity, Nodwin deconsolidation outcome).  
5. Use a staggered buy plan to mitigate execution/regulatory risks; maintain stop‑loss discipline.

## Investment Thesis

- Nazara is building a broad, IP‑driven gaming & youth‑media platform (mobile games, PC/console publishing, kids subscription, ad‑tech, esports) with clear cross‑sell and monetisation levers.  
- Management has demonstrated an aggressive M&A playbook (Curve, Fusebox, Datawrkz, Smaaash, Funky Monkeys) to assemble scale and IP — these can materially improve margins if integrated well.  
- Financial strength (low leverage, reasonable cash buffer) supports further investments, but free cash flow remains volatile while acquisitions are integrated.  
- Valuation is priced for perfection — significant upside depends on margins expanding and management executing without large impairments.  
- Regulatory risk (Online Gaming Bill) is the primary catalyst/overhang; market reaction is rational and necessitates caution until the full impact on associated investments is quantified.
