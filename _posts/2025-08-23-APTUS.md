### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Aptus Value Housing Finance India Ltd (APTUS) |
| **Sector** | Housing Finance |
| **Current Price** | ₹346 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹17,310 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-23 |

### Industry Overview

- Affordable / retail housing finance in India remains under-penetrated in Tier‑2 / Tier‑3 / Tier‑4 markets; strong structural demand driven by household formation, government affordable‑housing schemes and improving formal credit access.  
- Low-ticket secured lending (first‑time home buyers, self‑employed segments) is a high‑growth sub-segment with better risk-adjusted returns than unsecured lending.  
- Sector tailwinds: continued urbanisation, PMAY & state housing initiatives, improving mortgage penetration, and easier access to digital customer acquisition.  
- Sector headwinds: rising competition from banks / SFBs, sensitivity to interest rates, and potential localized stress in rural / seasonal income pockets.  
- Balance between growth and asset quality is critical — NBFC/HFCs with superior underwriting, calibrated expansion and liability diversification will outperform.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | 12-15% p.a. (housing finance); affordable / LIG segments: 18-22% p.a. |
| Market Size | ≈ ₹30,00,000 Cr (approx. national housing credit outstanding) |
| Sector Tailwinds | Large under‑penetrated demand, government support, digital sourcing efficiency |
| Sector Headwinds | Competition from banks/SFBs, funding cost volatility, regional economic shocks |
| Policy Support | Neutral to Positive — continued support for affordable housing schemes |
| Competition Level | High/Medium |
| Technology Disruption | Positive — digital origination & analytics aid scalability |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Affordable housing is a structural growth theme; penetration is low in many semi‑urban geographies Aptus targets.  
- Aptus’ product focus (first‑time buyers, self‑employed) aligns with the largest addressable underserved cohort.  
- Technology and branch density improvements materially lower cost per originations and support risk assessment.  
- Rising competition and potential rate shocks are real headwinds; execution in new states matters.  
- Overall a favourable sector with some execution and funding risk — score 8/10.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Debt-to-Equity | 1.59x | <1.5 (Good for non-financials) |
| Interest Coverage | 2.79x | >2.5x (Good) |
| Free Cash Flow | -₹1,411.75 Cr | Positive (Good) |
| Current Ratio | 9.38 | >1.2 (Good) |
| Quick Ratio | 9.38 | >1.0 (Good) |
| Net Debt | ₹6,449 Cr | Lower is better |
| Cash & Equivalents | ₹424 Cr | Higher is better |
| Capital Adequacy (CRAR) | ~70% | Regulatory minimum << company level |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Strong capitalisation: CRAR/net worth is very robust (large equity base → ability to fund growth without immediate capital raise).  
- Leverage (Debt/Equity ~1.6x) is moderate relative to housing‑finance peers (many peers carry higher leverage); funding mix diversified (banks, NHB, NCDs).  
- Liquidity buffer is healthy (cash + undrawn bank sanctions > ₹1,100–1,500 Cr across filings) — supports ALM and branch rollout.  
- Operating cash flows are negative historically (reflecting aggressive loan growth / lending working capital) — normal for a growing NBFC/HFC but must be monitored.  
- Interest coverage is adequate; provisioning coverage (PCR on Stage 3) and low absolute PCR (~25% reported) is a point to watch.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg / Median | Historical Avg |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| P/E Ratio | 21.7x | 20.9x (median) | — |
| P/B Ratio | 4.01x | 1.94x (median) | — |
| EV/EBITDA | 14.6x | 12.3x (median) | — |
| Market Cap / Sales | ~9.9x | — | — |
| PEG Ratio | — | — | — |
| EV/Sales | — | — | — |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Aptus trades at a premium P/B and modestly above median P/E and EV/EBITDA — premium is priced for superior ROE and faster growth.  
- ROE (~18.6%) and ROA (~7.7%) justify some premium vs. peers, but current P/B (~4x) already embeds elevated expectations for sustained high growth and margin stability.  
- Valuation is reasonable only if management delivers 25–30% AUM CAGR, stable NIM (~13%), and contained credit cost; any miss could compress multiple.  
- Score penalised for relative richness vs. median PBV; supporting factors (ROE, rating upgrades) keep it from being overvalued to an extreme degree.

#### Growth Potential: 9/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 18.6% |
| ROCE | 15.0% |
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | ~29% |
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | ~28.5% |
| AUM (FY25) | ₹10,865 Cr |
| AUM (Q1 FY26) | ₹11,267 Cr |
| CAPEX (guidance FY26) | ₹1,200 Cr (company guidance) |
| CAPEX/Revenue | ~66% (FY26 guidance vs FY25 revenue) |
| Dividend Payout | ~30% (FY25) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Historical 3–5 year growth ~28–29% demonstrates execution capability; management guidance of 25–30% AUM growth is credible given branch & digital rollout.  
- High ROE/ROCE signals capital efficiency, enabling reinvestment and shareholder returns.  
- Expansion into Maharashtra & Odisha plus digital lead channels provides additional growth levers.  
- CAPEX guidance for branch roll‑out is meaningful and capital‑intensive — growth is ambitious but supported by a strong equity base and diversified borrowings.  
- High score due to proven execution and clear runway; watch capital intensity and incremental return on branch investments.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | Frequent (quarterly + regular investor outreach) |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Clear — AUM ₹25,000 Cr target by FY28/29 |
| Management Communication | High — transparent commentary, guidance and detail |
| Governance Score | 7/10 |
| Transparency Rating | High |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | ~1.3% (FY25 payout) |
| Dividend History | Regular interim dividends in FY24/FY25 |
| Recent Buyback | None |
| Capital Allocation Efficiency | Reinvestment into branches & tech; PE / equity infusion seen |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Management provides frequent concalls, detailed presentations and consistent guidance; proactive funding and rating engagement.  
- Good transparency — detailed disclosures on NCDs, liquidity and branch metrics.  
- Governance concerns: promoter share dilution and significant pledge / encumbrance reported (~47.6% pledged figure published in filings) — reduces score.  
- Overall governance is competent, but promoter encumbrance and major stake sales by early investors require monitoring.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Average Target Price | ~₹400 (12‑month consensus from brokers) |
| Current Price | ₹346 |
| Upside / Downside | ~+16% (vs consensus target) |
| Buy Recommendations | Majority of recent broker notes: BUY |
| Hold / Sell Recommendations | Few / none in major recent coverage |
| Consensus Rating | BUY |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Multiple broker reports (recent coverage) maintain BUY with target ~₹400 on robust earnings and high ROE.  
- Broker valuation typically uses book‑value multiple (~3.7–4.3x BV) and forecasts steady AUM/NII growth.  
- Quality of research is consistent and supportive; consensus indicates market acceptance of the company’s growth story.

#### Technical Analysis & Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Period | Return | vs Nifty |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 Month | -0.2% | — |
| 3 Month | +2.8% | — |
| 6 Month | +14.7% | — |
| 1 Year | +11.6% | — |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| 50-DMA | ₹339 |
| 200-DMA | ₹325 |
| Volume Trend | High liquidity and episodic spikes |
| RSI (approx.) | Neutral‑to‑bullish |

| Market Sentiment & Near-term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| News Sentiment | Positive (rating upgrade, growth commentary) |
| Social Media Buzz | Moderate |
| Options Activity | Neutral to mildly bullish (no extreme skew) |
| Upcoming Events | Q2/Q3 quarterly results; branch expansion updates |
| Short-term Catalysts | Further rating upgrades, strong AUM print, lower CoF |
| Near-term Risks | NPA uptick, funding cost spikes |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Price trades above both 50‑DMA and 200‑DMA — positive technical posture.  
- Liquidity is strong (frequent high volume days), enabling tradeability.  
- Sentiment is constructive after rating upgrades and strong quarterly growth; technicals align with moderate bullishness.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % | Previous % | Change |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Promoter Holding | 40.37% (Jun 2025) | 52.99% (Mar 2025) | -12.62 pp |
| FII Holding | 30.41% (Jun 2025) | 27.74% (Mar 2025) | +2.67 pp |
| DII Holding | 16.04% (Jun 2025) | 9.88% (Mar 2025) | +6.16 pp |
| Public Holding | 13.19% (Jun 2025) | 9.40% (Mar 2025) | +3.79 pp |
| Pledged Shares | 47.6% (reported) | — | — |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | High (Steadview, Malabar, Smallcap World, other global funds) |
| Recent Changes | Significant stake sale by WestBridge (reduction in sold stake); promoter stake reduced materially |
| News Sentiment | Mixed (institutional interest up; promoter dilution & high pledge are concerns) |
| Options Activity | Neutral |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Institutional ownership has increased (FIIs/DIIs) which is positive for liquidity and governance oversight.  
- Large reduction in promoter / investor-promoter stake (WestBridge sale) and high reported pledge/encumbrance (47.6%) are governance / concentration flags and reduce comfort.  
- Quality of public investors is good — presence of marquee funds increases credibility.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | Premium | Aptus trades at a premium P/B (~4.0x) vs median peers (~1.9x) but commands premium due to higher ROE and growth trajectory. |
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Superior | ROE (~18.6%) and ROA (~7.7%) are above industry median; AUM / revenue growth outpaces many mid‑cap peers. |

## Key Strengths
- High and improving profitability metrics (ROE ~18–20%, ROA ~7–8%).  
- Proven high organic growth (AUM CAGR ~28–29%) with a clear branch + digital expansion roadmap.  
- Strong liquidity & capitalisation (CRAR/net worth comfortably high) supporting scaled growth.  
- Diversified funding mix (banks, NHB, NCDs) and recent credit rating upgrades that reduce cost of funds.  
- Robust operational model with digital LOS and high digital collection/agreements penetration.

## Key Concerns  
- Elevated P/B valuation — market has already priced in strong execution; disappointment could lead to sharp multiple contraction.  
- Promoter share reduction and high reported pledge/encumbrance (~47.6%) — governance and concentration risk.  
- PCR on Stage‑3 assets reported relatively low (~25%) — any sustained NPA ramp would require higher provisioning.  
- CAPEX / branch rollout is capital intensive — execution and incremental returns on new branches need monitoring.  
- Funding cost sensitivity — rise in borrowing costs could compress NIM if rating benefits or pass-through do not materialize.

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | AUM growth +35% in next 12 months; NIM expansion to ~13.4% (benefit from rating upgrade & lower CoF); credit cost contained at ≤30 bps; ROE rises toward 22%; book value increases modestly (EPS growth +35%). |
| **Catalysts** | Faster-than-planned branch productivity in Maharashtra/Odisha; continued rating upgrades (CARE AA → AA+), faster cost‑of‑fund benefit, pick‑up in direct assignment and securitisation, positive re‑rating of AHFC peers. |
| **Target Price** | ₹520 |
| **Probability** | 25% |
| **Justification** | Upside driven by both earnings growth and multiple expansion (P/B expansion from ~4.0x to ~6.0x driven by higher ROE and market rerating). Execution + rating tailwinds could produce ~50% upside. |

### Base Case Scenario (Most Likely)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | AUM growth 25–28% (management guidance); NIM ~13.0%; credit cost ~35–45 bps; ROE maintained ~18–20%; multiples stable or modestly expand to P/B ~4.6x. |
| **Execution Milestones** | Continued branch additions (30–40 p.a.), consistent digital sourcing (≥20% origination via digital channels), stable asset quality with GNPA ≤1.5% and PCR stays ~25–30%. |
| **Target Price** | ₹400 |
| **Probability** | 55% |
| **Justification** | This aligns with broker consensus targets and management guidance; expected return driven primarily by earnings growth (PAT) and modest multiple re-rating.

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | AUM growth slows to 10–15% (execution / funding stress), NIM compresses to <12.5% (CoF rise), credit cost rises >60–80 bps causing provisioning hit, ROE falls under 12–14%. |
| **Risk Factors** | Regional economic shock or sustained stress in self‑employed borrower cohorts; funding rate spike; material investor exit; promoter / governance related shock (forced share sales), or higher provisioning policy. |
| **Target Price** | ₹260 |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Justification** | Material deterioration in asset quality and funding cost compression would force multiple contraction and lower book value per share — downside scenario.

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bull Case** | +50.3% | ₹520 | 25% | +12.57% |
| **Base Case** | +15.6% | ₹400 | 55% | +8.58% |
| **Bear Case** | -24.9% | ₹260 | 20% | -4.97% |
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+16.19%** |

Probability‑weighted expected return = 25% × (+50.29%) + 55% × (+15.61%) + 20% × (-24.85%) = **+16.19% over 12 months**

Most Likely Scenario: Base Case — Evidence: consistent historical execution (AUM CAGR ~28–29%), management guidance for 25–30% AUM growth, strong capital adequacy and recent rating upgrades that support continued growth; broker consensus target ~₹400 aligns with this view.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | BUY |
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered / Tranche-based Buy (accumulate on dips) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹320 - ₹360 |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹280 |
| **Target Price** | ₹400 (12 months); secondary target ₹520 (18–24 months for bull outcome) |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) |
| **Timeline** | 12 months (base), 18–24 months (bull scenario) |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Probability‑weighted expected return ~+16.2% (12 months) justifies a BUY per the mandate (≥15% expected return).  
- Strong fundamentals: industry‑leading ROE, high NIM, low operating cost, proven growth track record and strong liquidity permit scaled growth without immediate capital stress.  
- Funding diversification and credit rating upgrades are likely to reduce cost of funds and support margin expansion.  
- Key risks (NPA uptick, promoter pledge/dilution, funding cost shocks) are acknowledged — hence staggered accumulation and a medium position size.  
- Use dips (near ₹320) to add, maintain stop loss discipline and monitor quarterly NPA / provisioning trends and rating developments.

## Investment Thesis

- Aptus is a high‑ROE, high‑growth housing finance franchise focused on first‑time home buyers and self‑employed borrowers in under‑penetrated semi‑urban markets — a structural growth niche.  
- The company combines branch expansion with a mobile‑first LOS and data analytics to drive cost efficiency and scalable origination, supporting superior margins and ROA/ROE.  
- Strong capital adequacy and a diversified funding mix (banks, NHB, NCDs) materially lower refinancing and ALM risk during scale‑up.  
- Recent rating upgrades and institutional investor interest validate funding and execution credibility; this should progressively lower funding cost and support multiple re‑rating.  
- Primary risks (asset quality, promoter pledge/holding changes, valuation premium) are real — but manageable if management sustains underwriting discipline and capital management.
