### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Jyoti Resins And Adhesives Ltd. (514448) |
| **Sector** | Chemical Manufacturing (Synthetic‑resin adhesives) |
| **Current Price** | ₹1,252 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹1,502 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- The Indian wood‑adhesives (white‑glue) market is expanding (~8% CAGR projected for the medium term); domestic housing and furniture demand are key drivers.  
- Market structure: dominated by a large branded incumbent (Pidilite) and several regional specialist players; Jyoti is the #2 retail white‑glue brand (Euro 7000) in India.  
- Raw‑material profile: high dependence on imported VAM (vinyl acetate monomer) → margins exposed to crude and international supply swings.  
- Distribution & demand drivers: organised retail, trade (carpenters) and institutional channels; brand & distribution investments materially affect market share.  
- Capex/scale effects: brownfield capacity additions materially improve fixed‑asset turnover and margins in a high fixed‑cost production model.

## Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Sector Metric | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Global wood‑adhesives market (2023) | ~US$7.0 bn |
| Indian wood‑adhesives CAGR (mid term) | ~8% (industry estimates) |
| Major listed peers (examples) | Pidilite, Atul, Vinati Organics |
| Jyoti’s retail position | #2 white‑glue brand (Euro 7000) |
| Raw‑material risk | High (VAM imports; crude‑linked) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- The underlying market has steady structural demand (housing, furniture, renovation), supporting multi‑year volume growth.  
- The segment is fragmented — this creates room for regional players like Jyoti to scale via distribution and branding.  
- Dependence on imported VAM is a material cyclical risk; raw‑material spikes can quickly compress margins.  
- Capacity additions and distribution expansion are high‑impact levers in this sector — successful execution translates directly into volume & margin gains.  
- Competitive intensity (Pidilite scale) caps pricing power; Jyoti’s niche strength in retail/field distribution is a differentiator but not an absolute moat.

#### Financial Strength: 9/10

| Financial Metric | Latest |
|------------------|--------|
| Revenue (FY25) | ₹284 Cr |
| PAT (FY25) | ₹74 Cr |
| TTM Sales / PAT | ₹290 Cr / ₹73 Cr |
| OPM (FY25) | ~31% |
| ROE / ROCE | 37.4% / 50.0% |
| Debt / Equity | 0.00 |
| Cash & Bank (Mar‑25) | ₹153 Cr |
| Quick ratio / Current ratio | 2.25 / 2.30 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong profitability: FY25 OPM ~31% and PAT ₹74 Cr on ₹284 Cr sales — margins significantly ahead of many chemical peers.  
- Very strong returns: ROE ~37% and ROCE ~50% indicate highly profitable capital deployment historically.  
- Clean balance sheet: net cash position, Debt/Equity ~0.0 and sizeable cash reserves (₹150+ Cr) provide flexibility for capex and buffer for commodity shocks.  
- Working capital: debtor days elevated (~161 days) and cash conversion cycle ~128 days — receivables concentration is a risk that management needs to manage as scale increases.  
- Cash flow profile: positive operating cash flows in recent years and disciplined capex funding from internal accruals (planned capex modest vs. cash on book).

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Valuation Metric | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Current P/E (TTM) | ~20.7x |
| Price / Book (PBV) | ~6.55x |
| Book Value / share | ₹191 |
| EV / EBITDA | ~13.7x |
| Market Cap | ₹1,502 Cr |

**Score Reasoning:**
- P/E (≈20.7x) is below large sector leaders but above median of chemical peers; EV/EBITDA ~13.7x is attractive relative to higher multiples in the speciality chemicals space.  
- PBV (~6.5x) is high vs. typical mid‑cap chemical peers (median PBV ~3.3x) — reflects high ROE and low replacement capital intensity rather than bloated book value.  
- Valuation incorporates growth and high returns; the forward multiple appears reasonable but leaves limited margin for execution misses.  
- Given strong return metrics (ROE/ROCE) and zero leverage, a premium vs. simple book multiple is defensible.  
- Key valuation risk: multiple compression if raw materials spike or volume growth slows.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Growth Metric | Value / Guidance |
|---------------|------------------|
| 5‑yr sales CAGR | ~31% |
| 3‑yr sales CAGR | ~16% |
| Management target (FY24‑FY27) | Volume CAGR 20‑25% |
| Planned capex | ₹30‑35 Cr (FY26 onwards) — brownfield capacity add |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Historical top‑line and profit CAGR (5‑yr sales 31%, PAT growth strong) show good execution.  
- Management has explicit targets (20‑25% volume CAGR, brownfield addition ~1,500 TPM → total ~42,000 TPA) which, if achieved, materially increases revenue base.  
- Margins have expanded (OPM moved to ~30%+), showing operating leverage; incremental volumes likely to be high‑margin given current utilisation.  
- The planned capex is moderate, likely internal‑funded — lowers execution financing risk.  
- Main downside: failure to convert distribution and market‑share gains in new states or raw‑material volatility that reduces gross margins.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Governance Metric | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| Promoter holding | 50.83% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.00% |
| Dividend policy | Avg payout ~15% (recent final dividend declared FY25) |
| Notable changes | Resignation of Company Secretary (Sep‑2023) — otherwise stable founder‑led management |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Founder/ promoter ownership >50% aligns management and shareholder interests; no pledge is a positive signal.  
- Regular dividends (c.15% payout) and conservative capital allocation (internal funding of capex) indicate shareholder‑friendly behaviour.  
- Management has been consistent in guided targets and investor outreach (concalls, conferences).  
- Limited institutional ownership (FIIs small) could limit external governance pressure but also reduces forced selling risk.  
- Few governance red flags visible; board composition disclosure and ESG disclosure could be deeper as the company scales.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Research Coverage (Last 12 months) | Key Callouts |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Broker: CD Equisearch (08 Aug 2025) | BUY; Target ₹1,764 (22x FY27E EPS 80.2) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent broker coverage (August 2025) provides an independent forward view — target ₹1,764 on FY27E assumptions.  
- Broker thesis aligns with our view: capacity expansion, distribution ramp and margin retention drive upside.  
- Coverage depth: forecasts and scenario commentary present but limited number of independent broker reports (coverage still narrow).  
- Analysts highlight commodity (VAM) risk and the need to monitor capacity utilisation closely.  
- Presence of broker coverage is positive for institutional awareness but more independent coverage would strengthen the case.

#### Technical Analysis: 6/10

| Technical Metric | Latest |
|------------------|--------|
| 50‑DMA | ~₹1,332 |
| 200‑DMA | ~₹1,338 |
| Current Price vs DMA | Price ~₹1,252 (below both 50 & 200 DMA) |
| 1‑yr performance | ~‑17% (12 months) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Short‑term technicals are mildly negative — CMP trades below 50‑ and 200‑DMA indicating short‑term momentum weakness.  
- The stock had a higher base earlier (52‑week high ~₹1,635) and has re‑tested lower levels (~₹1,200 range) — supports buy‑the‑dip setups for medium‑term investors.  
- Volume profile shows episodic spikes (institutional/retail activity) but no sustained sell‑off pattern.  
- Longer‑term uptrend (multi‑year CAGR strong) remains intact; technicals favour accumulation on dips for long‑term investors rather than momentum trading.  
- Risk: if price fails to reclaim 50/200 DMA sustainably, multiple short‑term sellers could press valuations.

#### Market Sentiments: 7/10

| Sentiment Signal | Recent Events |
|------------------|---------------|
| Recent results | Q1 FY26 (Jun‑25): Revenue ₹75.10 Cr (+8.6% YoY), PAT ~₹17.4 Cr (slight QoQ softness) |
| Corporate actions | Final dividend declared; active investor conferences in Aug‑2025 |
| News flow | Positive brand/marketing activity; investor outreach increasing |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Recent Q1 FY26: YoY revenue growth but some QoQ margin softness — mixed near‑term sentiment.  
- Management is actively engaging institutional investors and published concall transcripts and presentations — transparency is constructive.  
- Dividend and buybacks (none recent) keep retail investor confidence; strong retail base supports price resilience.  
- Market sentiment is broadly constructive on the capacity expansion thesis; watch for raw‑material headlines which move sentiment quickly.  
- No major negative news or governance scandal to dent sentiment at present.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 8/10

| Shareholding (Latest: Jun‑2025) | % |
|---------------------------------|---|
| Promoters | 50.83% |
| FIIs | 0.08% |
| DIIs | 1.22% |
| Public / Others | 47.87% |
| Notable public holders | Udita Tapan Patel ~6.02% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High promoter holding (≈51%); no promoter pledge — positive for alignment and stability.  
- Very low FII presence (sub‑1%) — both a risk (lower institutional support) and a benefit (reduced volatility from institutional flows).  
- Retail / high number of small shareholders indicate sticky demand; significant family/individual holdings among public shareholders.  
- Recent quarters show steady promoter holding (no dilution) and gradual DII entry — indicates measured institutional interest.  
- Ownership profile is stable; any future increase in institutional participation would be a positive catalyst.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E (x) | CMP / BV (x) | ROE (%) | EV/EBITDA (x) |
|------|--------------------|---------:|-------------:|--------:|--------------:|
| Pidilite Inds. | ₹155,159.33 Cr | 70.5 | 15.9 | 23.1 | 45.4 |
| Atul | ₹18,485.01 Cr | 37.0 | 3.3 | 9.1 | 17.6 |
| Vinati Organics | ₹17,730.97 Cr | 40.1 | 6.3 | 15.8 | 26.6 |
| Jyoti Resins (514448) | ₹1,502.10 Cr | 20.7 | 6.6 | 37.4 | 13.7 |
| Median (sample) | — | 31.0 | 3.4 | 10.5 | 18.0 |

- Jyoti trades at a lower P/E vs. major branded peers but has a premium PBV reflecting higher ROE; EV/EBITDA is reasonable vs. peers. The combination of high ROE/ROCE, zero debt and growth visibility supports a moderate premium vs. simple book‑value multiples.

## Key Strengths
- Strong margin profile (OPM ~30%+) and disciplined cash generation (PAT ₹74 Cr FY25).  
- High capital efficiency — ROE ~37% and ROCE ~50% historically.  
- Clean balance sheet (net cash; Debt/Equity ~0) and sizeable cash reserves (₹150+ Cr) for self‑funded capex.  
- Well‑distributed retail network (12,000 retailers; deep carpenter outreach) and a strong brand (Euro 7000).  
- Clear capacity expansion plan (brownfield), with management guidance of 20‑25% volume CAGR.

## Key Concerns  
- Raw‑material (VAM) import dependence — price spikes can swing margins quickly.  
- Elevated receivable days (~161 days) and cash conversion cycle (~128 days) — working capital management becomes critical at scale.  
- Limited institutional ownership — potential liquidity constraints in large sell pressure scenarios.  
- Valuation: PBV elevated vs. many peers; downside risk if growth or margins disappoint.  
- Execution risk on capacity ramp and geographic expansion into new states.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,900 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Full and timely ramp‑up of brownfield capacity (total ~42,000 TPA), volume CAGR >25% in FY26‑FY27, sustained OPM in mid‑30% range, and multiple expansion to ~24x FY27E EPS as growth visibility and institutional coverage increase. This scenario assumes VAM prices remain stable or decline and brand/distribution investments deliver faster market share gains.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,650 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management achieves guided volume CAGR (~20%); FY27E EPS ~₹80 (broker consensus); market re‑rates to ~20x FY27E given execution and low leverage, delivering ~31‑32% upside from CMP. Moderate working capital improvement and stable margins (30% OPM) support multiple retention.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,050 (6‑9 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Raw‑material (VAM) price spike or supply disruption compresses gross margins by 600–1,000 bps; volume growth disappoints (sub‑10%); multiple compresses to the low teens as investors penalise growth risk — causing ~15–20% downside from CMP.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP (₹1,252) | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|------------------------:|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹1,900 | +51.8% | Strong upside if capacity & market share ramp-up succeed; multiple expansion probable |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹1,650 | +31.8% | Most likely if management meets guidance (20%+ volume growth) and margins hold; supports BUY |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹1,050 | -16.1% | Execution or commodity shock scenario — downside risk present |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY — realistic scenario shows ~32% upside within 12 months and multiple pillars (financial strength, growth potential, shareholding) score strongly.  
- **Risk‑Reward Assessment:** High quality earnings, clean balance sheet and clear capacity plan give favorable risk/reward; main risks are VAM volatility and receivable concentration. Position sizing and stop‑loss recommended to manage downside.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price | Position Size | Time Horizon |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------:|--------------|
| BUY | Core (Fundamental, medium term) | Buy on dips ₹1,150 — ₹1,320 | ₹1,050 | ₹1,650 (12 months) | Medium (3–5% portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Business shows high capital efficiency (ROE/ROCE), zero net debt, and healthy cash balance — enabling self‑funded capacity expansion and low financial risk.  
- Realistic upside (~32%) vs. limited execution risk given management track record and clearly articulated capex plan.  
- Valuation is reasonable on EV/EBITDA and P/E vs. future earnings; PBV is high but justified by superior returns.  
- Monitor triggers: VAM price trends, capacity utilisation updates, receivable days reduction, and any change in dividend / capital allocation.

## Investment Thesis
1. High‑quality niche player in the white‑glue market with strong brand (Euro 7000) and a deep retail/distribution footprint that allows scalable growth.  
2. Financial strength: debt‑free balance sheet, strong cash flows and high ROE/ROCE enable disciplined, internally funded brownfield expansion.  
3. Growth lever: planned capacity add + aggressive distribution/marketing drive can deliver 20%+ volume CAGR and meaningful operating leverage.  
4. Valuation: currently trading at a mid‑teens P/E on forward earnings with attractive EV/EBITDA; upside accrues from earnings growth and potential multiple re‑rating.  
5. Key risks (VAM price, receivables) are measurable and monitorable — risk management (hedging, working capital optimisation) will be critical to realise targets.
