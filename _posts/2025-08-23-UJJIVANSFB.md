| **Sector** | Banking / Financial Services |
| **Current Price** | ₹43.7 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹8,461 Cr |

### Industry Overview

- Indian small‑finance banks (SFBs) and last‑mile lenders are shifting from pure microfinance to a mix of secured retail (affordable housing, micro‑mortgages), MSME, vehicle and gold loans — market structural shift is underway.  
- Addressable opportunity (from Ujjivan investor materials): micro‑finance market ~₹12–13 lakh Cr; secured loan opportunity in Tier‑II/III markets ~₹8–9 lakh Cr — attractive long runway.  
- Key tailwinds: PSL relief for SFBs (reduction in some priority ratios), falling policy rates (support to funding cost), digital adoption and product diversification.  
- Key headwinds: legacy micro‑finance stress (regional pockets, e.g., Karnataka/Tamil Nadu), margin compression while migrating to secured assets, and competitive pressure from other SFBs/NBFCs.  
- Regulatory watch: Universal‑bank license application (filed Feb 2025) is optionality — approval materially changes funding & product access.

## Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | 10–15% (3‑5 yr CAGR estimate for retail‑secured + micro lending) |
| Market Size | Micro‑finance ≈ ₹12–13 lakh Cr; Secured retail opportunity ≈ ₹8–9 lakh Cr |
| Sector Tailwinds | PSL relaxation, digital onboarding, lower policy rates |
| Sector Headwinds | Regional credit stress, competition from NBFCs/SFBs, regulatory guardrails |
| Policy Support | Positive (RBI / PSL changes) |
| Competition Level | High |
| Technology Disruption | Positive (digital origination, AI underwriting) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- SFB sector structurally attractive (large underserved markets) but execution and asset‑quality discipline are critical.  
- Ujjivan benefits from strong retail presence and digital capabilities that match sector tailwinds.  
- However, sector has concentrated regional stress pockets (e.g., Karnataka/TN) and many competitors are moving into secured lending — moderates score.

#### Financial Strength: 7/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| CRAR (Total CAR) | 23.1% (FY25) | >15% (Regulatory comfort) |
| Gross Loan Book | ₹32,122 Cr (FY25) | Higher is growth |
| Deposits | ₹37,630 Cr (Mar 2025) | Higher is good |
| CASA | ₹9,612 Cr (25.5% of deposits, Mar 2025) | Higher CASA reduces CoF |
| Borrowings | ₹2,845 Cr (Mar 2025) | Lower reliance better |
| Net Cash Flow (FY25) | ₹633 Cr (Net cash flow FY25) | Positive |
| NIM | 8.8% (FY25) | Trend: moderating |
| GNPA / NNPA | 2.2% / 0.5% (FY25) | GNPA improving; NNPA low |
| PCR | 78% (FY25) | Adequate coverage |
| Int. Coverage (non‑bank metric) | 1.24 | Not a direct bank metric; low for non‑financials |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong capital buffer (CRAR ~23%) provides headroom for growth and provisioning; liquidity metrics (LCR > 100% in disclosures) are comfortable.  
- Deposit franchise expanded strongly (20% YoY), CASA traction improving (25–27%). That strengthens liability franchise and reduces funding risk.  
- Asset quality trending better (GNPA ~2.2%; PCR ~78%) but credit cost was elevated in FY25; watch for normalization.  
- NIM has compressed from mid-9s toward high‑8s/low‑8s as mix shifts to secured; cost‑of‑funds pressure remains a near‑term risk.

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg / Comment | Historical |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------|------------|
| P/E | 16.0x | Peer median ~16–17x | |
| P/BV | 1.39x | Peer median ~1.0–1.3x | |
| EV/EBITDA | 13.1x | In line with mid‑tier SFBs | |
| Market Cap / Sales | ~1.32x (indicative) | Sector varies | |
| PEG / Growth adj. | Mixed (growth uneven) | | |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Valuation is reasonable relative to SFB peers — neither deep discount nor expensive (P/E ~16, P/B ~1.4).  
- Current multiples roughly price in normalization but leave upside if asset quality & ROE recover.  
- Need earnings visibility (credit cost normalization) for re‑rating — that is the key valuation catalyst.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 12.4% (FY25) |
| ROCE | 8.5% (FY25) |
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | ~31% (3Y), 19% (5Y) per disclosures |
| Loan Growth (FY25) | +8–11% YoY (FY25 reported ~+8% YoY on book) |
| CAPEX | Guidance / FY25: ~₹100 Cr (digital/branch) |
| CAPEX / Revenue | Low (bank invests in tech & branch rollout) |
| Dividend Payout | Low / conservative (management prioritizes capital) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Clear strategic pivot: secured book (housing, micro‑mortgages, vehicle, gold, MSME) scaling rapidly – secured share rose to ~44–46% in FY25/Q1FY26. That materially increases scalable, lower‑loss growth.  
- Deposit base is expanding, enabling 15–20% medium‑term loan growth guidance. Management targets ROE 10–12% for FY26 as an explicit goal.  
- Execution risk exists while the secured book scales and new products mature, but the growth runway is significant.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | Frequent (quarterly, investor roadshows) |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Clear (diversify to secured loan book; universal license optionality) |
| Management Communication | Transparent; regular presentations & concall notes |
| Governance Score | 7/10 |
| Transparency Rating | Medium‑High |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Reverse Merger | Reverse merger completed May 2024 (UFSL → Bank) |
| Management changes | New MD & CEO appointed July 2024 (Sanjeev Nautiyal) |
| ESOP allotments | Multiple ESOP issuances (active employee incentives) |
| Dividend history | Small payout FY24 (₹1.50 final), FY25 conservative |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management has been communicative (detailed concalls/presentations). Transition to a new leadership team appears professional and focused on de‑risking and diversification.  
- Corporate actions (reverse merger, ESOP activity) require monitoring for dilution and incentive alignment — so middling score but no governance red flags (no promoter pledge, good independent director presence).

---

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Selected Broker TPs | ICICI: ₹60; Emkay: ₹45; Geojit: ₹41 |
| Average Target (sample) | ~₹49 |
| Current Price | ₹43.7 |
| Upside/Downside (avg) | ~ +12% vs CMP |
| Consensus Rating | Mostly Buy/Accumulate |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Broker coverage is constructive: most houses view the long‑term transition positively (ratings range from ACCUMULATE to BUY). Targets vary because of modeling differences on credit cost and ROE ramp.  
- Analysts flag the same watch items we do: credit cost normalization, secured book scaling and timing of universal bank conversion.

#### Technical Analysis & Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Period | Return | vs Nifty (approx) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 Month | -7% (approx) | Underperformed |
| 3 Month | +4% (approx) | In‑line |
| 6 Month | +10% (approx) | Slightly outperformed |
| 1 Year | +1% (approx) | Flat |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| RSI | Neutral (mid‑range) |
| 50‑DMA | ₹44.9 |
| 200‑DMA | ₹42.6 |
| Volume Trend | Variable; periodic spikes on news/calls |

| Market Sentiment & Near‑term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| News Sentiment | Mixed (operational progress vs credit‑cost noise) |
| Social Media / Retail | Moderate attention (active MOM trading days) |
| Upcoming Events | Quarterly results, RBI decision on universal license (monitor) |
| Options Activity | Not centrally available in this report |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Technicals mixed: stock trades around its 200‑DMA (support) but below 50‑DMA; recent volatility driven by quarter a/o guidance and ARC / provisioning news.  
- Liquidity and traded volumes are healthy (several high‑volume sessions), but sentiment is cautious until credit cost normalizes.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % (Jun 2025) | Prior / Change |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Promoter Holding | 0.00% (post reverse‑merger adjustments) | Promoter structure changed after merger |
| FII Holding | 19.55% | Increased materially post‑merger |
| DII Holding | 16.82% | Increasing institutional participation |
| Public / Retail | 63.61% | Retail base large; number of shareholders high |
| Pledged Shares | 0.00% | No pledge reported |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | IFC, Bowhead, Duro One, Newquest among FIIs; notable retail investors (Dolly Khanna) present |
| Recent Changes | Institutional buying after reverse merger; promoter dilution visible |
| Promoter Confidence | Neutral (0% promoter — structure shifted) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- The shareholding base is now more institutionally distributed (IFC and several global funds present), which is positive for governance and liquidity.  
- Promoter dilution / reverse merger changed ownership structure — watch for long‑term alignment. ESOP issuances are sizeable and should be monitored for dilution.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | In‑line to slight premium | P/E ~16 vs peer median ~16–17x; P/B ~1.39 vs peer median ~1.0–1.3x — priced for recovery but not stretched |
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Comparable | ROE ~12.4% (below historical peaks but competitive among SFBs given current cycle); asset quality (GNPA 2.2%) is comparable/ better than several peers |

---

## Key Strengths
- Strong capital buffer: CRAR ~23% provides headroom for growth/provisioning.  
- Rapid secured‑book diversification (housing, micro‑mortgage, vehicle, gold) reduces pure MFI concentration risk.  
- Robust deposit traction (₹37,630 Cr; CASA ~25–27%) improving funding mix.  
- Active management communication and credible investor outreach (roadshows, concalls).  
- Universal‑bank conversion application provides optional upside (new product & deposit access).

## Key Concerns  
- Elevated credit cost in FY25 and localized borrower stress (Karnataka, some TN districts) — watch PAR trends.  
- NIM pressure as portfolio mix shifts and funding cost normalizes; management guidance indicates moderation.  
- Execution risk in scaling secured products while maintaining underwriting discipline.  
- Promoter / ownership restructuring (reverse merger) and large ESOP issuance — monitor dilution and incentives.  
- Short‑term earnings volatility — PAT fell sharply in FY25 vs FY24.

## Scenario Analysis

(Inputs: TTM EPS = 2.73 (latest TTM EPS from company reporting / screener data). Targets shown are 12‑month targets; calculations use EPS × P/E.)

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Advances growth ~25% YoY, Total Income +20% YoY, NIM recovers to ~9.0% (cost of funds eases), credit cost normalises to ~1.5% (FY26), ROE → 14% | 
| **Catalysts** | RBI grants universal‑bank optionality (clarity/timing), faster CASA pickup, secured products scale with low slippage, institutional flows continue | 
| **EPS (assumption)** | EPS = 2.73 × (1 + 60%) = 4.37 |
| **Valuation multiple** | P/E = 16x (premium for cleaner earnings & higher ROE) |
| **Target Price (12m)** | EPS × P/E = 4.37 × 16 = ₹69.9 ≈ **₹70** |
| **Return vs CMP** | (70 – 43.7) / 43.7 = **+60%** |
| **Probability** | **25%** |
| **Justification** | If management executes secured book scale‑up, credit cost normalizes and the universal‑bank optionality materializes, earnings could re‑rate quickly and deliver double‑digit EPS growth + multiple expansion. Institutional interest and improved liquidity could support higher multiples. |

---

### Base Case Scenario (Most Likely)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Advances growth ~18–20% YoY, Total Income +12–15% YoY, NIM ~8.0–8.5% (stabilize), credit cost ~2.3–2.4% (management guidance), ROE ~10–12% |
| **Execution Milestones** | Secured book continues to grow to ~50% over next 12–24 months; CASA slowly improves to ~27–30% by year‑end; credit cost declines from FY25 peak as collections and ARC sales work through | 
| **EPS (assumption)** | EPS = 2.73 × (1 + 35%) = 3.69 |
| **Valuation multiple** | P/E = 15x (in‑line) |
| **Target Price (12m)** | EPS × P/E = 3.69 × 15 = ₹55.35 ≈ **₹55** |
| **Return vs CMP** | (55 – 43.7) / 43.7 = **+26.7%** |
| **Probability** | **55%** |
| **Justification** | Management guidance and recent results indicate recovery is likely but will take quarters; this scenario assumes execution of secured book and liability improvements while credit costs normalize — this is the base thesis and aligns with broker consensus (many TPs in ₹41–60 range). |

---

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Loan growth stalls (0–5%), sustained NIM compression (≤7%), credit cost increases to 3.5–4.0% (fresh slippages / regional stress & slower recoveries), ROE falls to single digits |
| **Risk Factors** | Adverse macro/regulatory shock, deterioration in microfinance pockets (Karnataka / TN), inability to scale secured book profitably, funding cost spike |
| **EPS (assumption)** | EPS = 2.73 × (1 − 30%) = 1.91 |
| **Valuation multiple** | P/E = 9x (discounted due to risk) |
| **Target Price (12m)** | EPS × P/E = 1.91 × 9 = ₹17.2 ≈ **₹17** |
| **Return vs CMP** | (17 – 43.7) / 43.7 = **−61%** |
| **Probability** | **20%** |
| **Justification** | If regional stresses worsen or the secured products see higher than expected slippage while funding costs spike, earnings could materially compress and multiples could re‑rate lower rapidly. |

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Bull Case | +60% | ₹70 | 25% | +15.0% |
| Base Case | +26.7% | ₹55 | 55% | +14.7% |
| Bear Case | −61% | ₹17 | 20% | −12.2% |
| **Expected Return** |  |  | **100%** | **+17.5%** |

Probability‑weighted expected return calculation:
- = 25% × 60% + 55% × 26.7% + 20% × (−61%)  
- = 15.0% + 14.7% − 12.2% = **+17.5% over 12 months**

Most Likely Scenario: **Base Case** (55% probability) — evidence: management guidance (advances growth ~20%, credit cost guidance 2.3–2.4%), secured loan traction, deposit momentum, and broker consensus clustering around mid‑targets. The base case assumes no idiosyncratic shock and steady improvement.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | **BUY** |
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered Buy / Buy on Dips (scale in over 3–4 tranches) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹40 – ₹46 |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹34 (initial tranche) |
| **Target Price** | ₹55 (12 months) |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2–5% portfolio) — increase to Large (5–10%) only if base case milestones (PCR, GNPA trend, CASA pickup) hold |
| **Timeline** | 12 months (primary); optionality to hold longer if universal‑bank license granted and fundamentals improve |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Probability‑weighted expected return (~+17.5%) exceeds the BUY threshold (≥ 15%) per the report rules — hence BUY.  
- Catalysts: secular shift to secured book, improving deposit base (CASA), strong capital buffer (CRAR ~23%), and universal‑bank optionality.  
- Risks to monitor and manage with staging of buys: PAR/GNPA trends (state‑level), cost‑of‑funds trajectory, and any surprise regulatory developments.  
- Tactical approach: stagger purchases and add on dips below ₹40; re‑evaluate if GNPA > 3% or PCR falls materially below 70% or NIM compresses beyond guidance.

## Investment Thesis (five points)

1. Ujjivan is executing a credible strategic pivot from a micro‑finance dominated portfolio to a diversified, secured‑loan franchise (housing, micro‑mortgage, MSME, vehicle, gold) — this reduces concentration risk and supports sustainable ROE.  
2. Liability franchise is strengthening: deposits ~₹37,630 Cr with CASA improving (~25–27%), lowering funding cost and supporting margin recovery when policy rates ease.  
3. Strong capital adequacy (CRAR ~23%) and liquidity (LCR >100% disclosures) provide resilience to manage provisioning and grow safely during the transition.  
4. Universal‑bank licence application is a meaningful optionality — approval would materially expand product scope and low‑cost deposit access (positive re‑rating catalyst).  
5. Near‑term noise (elevated credit cost in FY25) is largely driven by one‑off provisioning & legacy stressed pools; base case expects normalization, unlocking earnings upside.
