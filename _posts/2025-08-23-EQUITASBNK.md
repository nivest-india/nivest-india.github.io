### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Equitas Small Finance Bank Ltd (EQUITASBNK) |
| **Sector** | Small Finance Banks |
| **Current Price** | ₹54.9 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹6,259 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-23 |

### Industry Overview

- Small‑finance banks (SFBs) operate in a rapidly growing retail & small‑enterprise credit market; sector growth expected ~12–15% p.a. over next 3–5 years driven by financial inclusion and secular demand for small business and retail credit.
- Key tailwinds: deepening financial penetration in semi‑urban/rural India, rising retail credit demand (used vehicles, affordable housing, MSME credit), and digital distribution enabling low‑cost sourcing.
- Key headwinds: concentrated micro‑finance (MFI) stress, state‑level collection ordinances, and funding cost volatility in changing interest‑rate cycles.
- Competitive landscape: increasing competition from other SFBs and NBFCs on used‑vehicle and small business lending; execution in deposit mobilisation and digital cross‑sell will determine winners.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | ~12–15% (3–5 yr) |
| Market Size | Large (retail & small business credit — expanding) |
| Sector Tailwinds | Financial inclusion, digital distribution, secured retail demand |
| Sector Headwinds | MFI regulatory risk, state ordinances, funding cost volatility |
| Policy Support | RBI supportive of SFB growth; stricter MFI guardrails improving long‑term discipline |
| Competition Level | High |
| Technology Disruption | Positive (digital origination & analytics) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- SFB sector poised for steady growth as retail & small business credit expands; demand drivers are structural (urbanisation, formalisation).
- Regulatory focus on micro‑finance (guardrails) reduces long‑term systemic risk but causes short‑term headwinds for MFI‑heavy lenders.
- Banks with strong deposit franchises and digital pipelines (for low‑cost sourcing) stand to gain; Equitas’ Liability‑2.0 + Super‑App strategy aligns with sector tailwinds.
- Competition and rate cycles create execution risk; success depends on liability mix, product diversification, and prudent credit underwriting.

#### Financial Strength: 6/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| CRAR (Total) | 20.48% (Jun‑25) | >15% (Regulatory) |
| Debt / Equity | 7.45 | Peer median ~7.45 |
| Net Debt (Net cash) | -Rs 2,699 Cr (Cash ≈ Rs 4,836 Cr vs Borrowings ≈ Rs 2,137 Cr, Mar‑25) | Lower/net cash is better |
| CASA Ratio | 29% (Q1 FY26) | Higher is better |
| GNPA | 2.82% (Q1 FY26) | Lower better |
| NNPA | 0.95% (Q1 FY26) | Lower better |
| PCR (Provision Cover) | 67.03% (Q1 FY26) | Higher is better |
| NIM | 6.55% (Q1 FY26) | Peer varies; trend important |
| LCR (Liquidity) | ~209% (Q1 FY26) | >100% (Good) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Capital adequacy (CRAR ~20.5%) and liquidity (LCR >> regulatory minimum) are strong — provides buffer to absorb provisions and support growth.
- Deposit franchise is healthy (Total deposits ~Rs 44,379 Cr Q1 FY26; CASA ~29%), supporting funding stability.
- Net cash position (cash > borrowings) is a positive; limited wholesale dependence.
- Weaknesses: NIM compressed materially (6.55% in Q1 FY26) and credit cost spiked due to MFI stress; profitability and interest‑coverage proxies are under pressure (TTM PAT negative).
- Overall balance‑sheet resilient, but earnings quality and provisioning dynamics reduce near‑term financial strength score.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Median | Historical |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| P/E | N/A (TTM EPS negative) | 16.7 (median peer) | N/A |
| P/BV | 1.03 | 1.03 (median peer) | ~1.2 historically |
| EV / EBITDA | 15.1 | 15.19 (median peer) | N/A |
| Market Cap / Sales | 0.99 (MCap Rs 6,259 Cr / Revenue Rs 6,312 Cr FY25) | — | — |
| PEG / EV/Sales | N/A | — | — |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Valuation is close to peer median on P/B (≈1.03) and EV/EBITDA in line with peers — implies market is pricing in normalized book‑value but lower earnings.
- P/E is not meaningful due to recent losses and negative TTM EPS; recovery in earnings is the key re‑rating trigger.
- Given CAR strength and potential recovery, current price offers upside if execution improves; near‑term valuation tied to de‑risking outcome and margin recovery.

#### Growth Potential: 7/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 2.43% (Trailing, extract) |
| ROCE | 6.85% (extract) |
| Advances Growth (Guidance) | 15–16% (FY26 guidance) |
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | 19% |
| CAPEX | Strategic digital spend (Super‑App) — largely in last phase |
| Dividend Payout | Historically low / inconsistent (recent payouts resumed but limited) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management guidance targets mid‑teen advances growth (15–16% for FY26) with secured book growing >20% — credible given branch network and digital channels.
- Mix shift to secured SBL, used vehicles, housing and MLAP improves risk‑adjusted yields long term but reduces near‑term headline NIM.
- Digital initiatives (Selfe App, Super‑App) and new products (cards, forex, NRI deposits) can scale fee income and reduce cost‑to‑serve.
- Historical sales CAGR (~19% 5Y) supports growth potential, but profitability volatility (MFI stress) tempers the near‑term outlook.

#### Corporate Governance: 6/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | High (regular disclosures & investor presentations) |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Moderate → Clear shift to secured loans + digital |
| Management Communication | Transparent and proactive on provisioning |
| Governance Score | 6/10 |
| Transparency Rating | Medium‑High |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | ~1.82% (extract) |
| ESOP Issuances | Large & frequent ESOP allotments (2023–2025) — notable dilution consideration |
| Capital Raises | IBPC sale (Rs 1,250 Cr), Tier‑II Rs 500 Cr; Tier‑I equity planned Rs 1,250 Cr |
| Promoter Holding | 0.00% (post restructuring) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management is communicative and has taken decisive action (front‑loaded provisioning, di‑risking). Concall transcripts are detailed and candid.
- Promoter holding at 0% is unusual for an SFB and increases emphasis on institutional investor base; review required on alignment of long‑term incentives.
- Large ESOP issuances across 2023–25 are dilutive and need closer monitoring (impact on ROE / EPS recovery).
- Capital actions have been managed transparently; planned Tier‑I raise to support growth is positive if executed timely.

#### Research Reports: 6/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Average Target Price | ₹67.8 (avg of recent broker targets: ₹80, ₹70, ₹55, ₹57, ₹77) |
| Current Price | ₹54.9 |
| Average Upside/Downside | ≈ +23% vs CMP |
| Buy Recommendations | 3 |
| Hold Recommendations | 1 |
| Reduce/ Sell | 1 |
| Consensus | Mixed (Buy/Hold/Reduce) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Broker coverage is active and mixed: several reports (Motilal Oswal) positive citing de‑risking and ABV multiples; others (Emkay, ICICI) cautious given provisioning and near‑term earnings shock.
- Average broker TP (~₹68) implies ~20–25% upside, consistent with our scenario-weighted view.
- Analysts diverge mainly on timing/extent of MFI normalisation and capital raise execution.

#### Technical Analysis & Market Sentiments: 4/10

| Period | Return |
|--------|--------|
| 1 Month | -12.5% |
| 3 Month | -14.6% |
| 6 Month | -8.0% |
| 1 Year | -33.8% |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| 50‑DMA | ~₹60.00 (Aug‑22‑2025) |
| 200‑DMA | ~₹65.76 (Aug‑22‑2025) |
| Volume Trend | Elevated trading volumes with intermittent spikes |
| Price Position vs DMA | Price (₹54.9) below 50‑DMA & 200‑DMA (bearish) |

| Market Sentiment & Near‑term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| News Sentiment | Mixed – provisioning/headline loss dampens sentiment |
| Institutional Activity | Active (DIIs rising; FIIs present) |
| Upcoming Events | Q2 FY26 results, Tier‑I equity raise execution, RBI/sector news |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is below key moving averages with negative returns over multiple horizons — technical momentum is weak.
- Elevated volumes indicate active trading interest, but sentiment remains cautious after the Q1 provisioning and reported loss.
- Near‑term catalysts (capital raise, asset‑quality signs) will drive sentiment swings; technicals suggest waiting for a base confirmation or buying on dips.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 7/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % (Jun‑25) | Previous % | Change |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------|--------|
| Promoter Holding | 0.00% | Previously ~74.5% (pre‑restructure) | N/A |
| FII Holding | 16.30% | 19.50% (Mar‑24) | Declining from peak |
| DII Holding | 47.13% | 45.21% (Mar‑24) | Increasing |
| Public Holding | 36.57% | 35.28% (Mar‑24) | Increasing |
| Pledged Shares | 0.00% | 0.00% | No pledge |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | Notable: Ashish Dhawan (~3.8%), IFC (~2.9%), Ellipsis Partners etc. |
| Recent Changes | Institutional accumulation (DII + FIIs active) |
| Promoter Pledge | Nil |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Institutional investor base is strong and includes high‑quality names (Ashish Dhawan, IFC), which supports governance and monitoring.
- Promoter stake being nil reduces classic promoter skin‑in‑the‑game metric — a mixed signal; however, institutional ownership concentration provides oversight.
- No pledged shares (positive); DIIs increasing indicates confidence from domestic funds.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | In‑line | P/B ~1.03 vs peer median 1.03; EV/EBITDA ~15.1 in line with median 15.19. |
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Inferior (near‑term) | ROE (≈2.4%) below peer median (~10.4%); profit volatility and negative TTM EPS lower near‑term performance. |

## Key Strengths
- Strong capital buffer: CRAR ~20.5% (post IBPC sale & Tier‑II raise) — provides room to absorb losses and fund growth.
- Deposit franchise & liquidity: Deposits ~Rs 44,000 Cr and LCR >200% (ample liquidity); CASA ~29% provides a stable funding base.
- Rapid portfolio transformation: Secured book ~86% of advances (SBL, housing, vehicle) reduces future unsecured exposure.
- Active digital & product push: Selfe App, Super‑App and new products (cards, forex, NRI deposits) that can scale fee income and reduce cost‑to‑serve.
- Quality institutional investors and no pledged promoter shares.

## Key Concerns
- MFI stress & provisioning: Elevated credit cost from MFI segment created a one‑off/proactive provisioning impact (Q1 FY26 loss) and uncertain near‑term recovery timing.
- Profitability & margin pressure: NIM compression (Q1 FY26 6.55%) and negative TTM EPS make near‑term earnings uncertain.
- Promoter holding structure & ESOP dilution: Promoter 0% and heavy ESOP issuances (2023–25) raise dilution/governance considerations.
- Execution risk: Scaling new products (cards, AD1 services) and achieving cost‑to‑income improvements are execution‑sensitive.
- Market sentiment & technicals: Price below DMA50/200 and recent underperformance increases short‑term risk.

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Advances growth +20% over 12 months; NIM recovers to 7.5% as funding cost eases; overall credit cost normalises to ~1% (MFI shrink to <5% of book); RoA improves to ~1.5%; BV/Share rises to ~₹60; valuation expansion to P/B ~1.6x due to improved ROE. |
| **Catalysts** | Faster MFI normalisation, successful Tier‑I equity raise (Rs 1,250 Cr) executed timely, strong pickup in fee income (cards/forex), repo easing reduces deposit costs, improved collection metrics. |
| **Target Price** | ₹85 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Justification** | Upside requires multiple favorable events: asset‑quality stabilisation, margin recovery and a re‑rating driven by improved ROE. Motilal Oswal / broker bullish scenarios support this band; probability modest given execution risks. |

### Base Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Advances growth 15–16% (FY26 guidance); NIM stabilises ~7.0% within 12 months; overall credit cost falls to ~1.2–1.5% as MFI declines and one‑off provisions are absorbed; BV/Share ~₹53–56; market assigns P/B ~1.3x. |
| **Execution Milestones** | Continued secured‑book growth, liability franchise stabilises (CASA improvement), Tier‑II/Tier‑I capital raises executed as planned, cost‑to‑income trend improves modestly. |
| **Target Price** | ₹70 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 60% |
| **Justification** | Most likely path — management guidance, strong deposit base, and active provisioning imply a recovery path with modest re‑rating to P/B ~1.3x as earnings normalise. This aligns with several broker base cases. |

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Prolonged MFI stress; additional provisions required; advances growth slows to <5–8%; NIM compresses to ≤6.0% from renewed funding stress; BV falls modestly; market compresses P/B to ~0.8x. |
| **Risk Factors** | New state ordinances or prolonged collection issues; failure/delay in Tier‑I equity raise; macro slowdown causing slippages across secured segments. |
| **Target Price** | ₹43 (12 months) |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Justification** | Already‑elevated provisioning demonstrates downside risk if MFI or regional stress re‑emerges. A failure to raise capital or further slippages would materially compress valuation.

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Bull Case | +54.8% | ₹85 | 20% | +10.96% |
| Base Case | +27.4% | ₹70 | 60% | +16.45% |
| Bear Case | -21.7% | ₹43 | 20% | -4.34% |
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+23.07%** |

Probability‑weighted expected return = 20% × (+54.8%) + 60% × (+27.4%) + 20% × (‑21.7%) = **+23.1% over 12 months**

Most Likely Scenario: Base Case — Evidence: management guidance (15–16% advance growth), robust deposit franchise and high CRAR provide a credible path to recovery; brokers’ consensus targets cluster near the base case (~₹67–77).

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | STRONG BUY |
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered buy (accumulate on dips) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹52 — ₹58 |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹44 |
| **Target Price** | ₹70 (12 months) |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) |
| **Timeline** | 12 months (primary), 18–24 months (if executing turnaround) |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Probability‑weighted expected return ~+23% (12 months) exceeds the STRONG BUY threshold (≥20%).
- Strong capital (CRAR ~20.5%) and liquidity (LCR >200%) mitigate downside while management actively de‑risked MFI book.
- Deposit franchise and digital initiatives support sustainable growth and potential margin recovery; broker average targets align with upside.
- Near‑term risks (provisions, NIM compression, ESOP dilution) mean position should be sized moderately and established in tranches.
- Revisit allocation on clear signs of asset‑quality normalisation or after successful Tier‑I raise.

## Investment Thesis

- Equitas SFB is transitioning toward a secured‑loan‑centric franchise (SBL, used vehicles, housing) which materially lowers systemic MFI risk; this should sustainably reduce credit cost and support steady NII growth.
- Strong balance‑sheet (CRAR ~20.5%), healthy liquidity and a growing deposit base provide the bank flexibility to absorb near‑term shocks and fund growth.
- Management has taken conservative, proactive provisioning steps (one‑off overlays) that should clear the runway for normalized earnings in H2 FY26–FY27 if collections stabilize.
- Digital distribution (Selfe App, Super‑App) and new products (cards, forex, NRI deposits) offer significant optionality to grow fee income and improve deposit stickiness.
- Downside is capped by reasonable valuations (P/B ~1.03) and quality institutional ownership; key triggers for re‑rating are MFI normalisation and demonstrable NIM/ROE improvement.
