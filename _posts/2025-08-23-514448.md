### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Jyoti Resins And Adhesives Ltd. (514448) |
| **Sector** | Speciality Chemicals (Adhesives) |
| **Current Price** | ₹1,277 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹1,532 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-23 |

### Industry Overview
- Large but fragmented domestic white‑glue (wood adhesives) market; company estimates TAM ≈ ₹7,500 Cr with meaningful headroom for branded penetration.  
- Structural tailwinds: housing/renovation cycle, urbanisation, growth in organised furniture/OEM and rising DIY adoption.  
- Cyclical headwinds: construction seasonality and raw‑material (VAM) import‑linked volatility; intensifying competition from established players.  
- Channel economics matter: dealer & carpenter loyalty programs drive repeat purchase and stickiness; distribution density is a key barrier to rapid state‑level market share gains.  
- Technology/ESG: gradual shift toward low‑VOC, water‑based formulations — product innovation will be necessary but not a disruptive threat in short term.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Key Areas | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Industry Growth Rate | ~8% CAGR (3-5 yrs, organised segment est.) |
| Market Size | ₹7,500 Cr (company estimate) |
| Sector Tailwinds | Housing demand, organised retail, premiumisation |
| Sector Headwinds | VAM price volatility, seasonality, strong incumbents |
| Policy Support | Neutral — indirect support via large housing schemes |
| Competition Level | High |
| Technology Disruption | Neutral |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Market large with room for branded players to scale; white‑glue remains an under‑penetrated category relative to overall adhesives market.  
- Company can outgrow sector via distribution + loyalty, but incumbents (Pidilite) have scale advantages and deep trade relationships.  
- Raw‑material dependence on VAM (imported) is a recurring risk; pricing pass‑through possible but lagged.  
- Execution of state‑level rollouts and dealer onboarding will determine whether company captures a structurally larger share — hence industry opportunity but execution risk justifies a 7/10.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Financial Metrics | Value | Benchmark |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Debt-to-Equity | 0.00 | <1.5 (Good) |
| Interest Coverage | 1,387x | >2.5x (Good) |
| Free Cash Flow (FY25) | ₹13.02 Cr | Positive (Good) |
| Operating Cash Flow (FY25, reconciled) | ₹48.39 Cr | Positive (Good) |
| Current Ratio | 2.30 | >1.2 (Good) |
| Quick Ratio | 2.25 | >1.0 (Good) |
| Net Debt | ₹0 Cr (net cash) | Lower is better |
| Cash & Equivalents (Mar‑25) | ₹153 Cr | Higher is better |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Strong balance sheet: debt‑free, large cash & fixed deposits (~₹150+ Cr) and negative net‑debt provide flexibility to fund brownfield/greenfield growth.  
- High ROCE/ROE (ROCE ~50%, ROE ~37%) indicate capital efficiency and quality returns on incremental capex.  
- Operating cash flows are healthy (company‑reconciled OCF ≈ ₹48 Cr FY25) but free cash flow is modest vs. cash on books — capex/timing and FD classification cause variability.  
- Working‑capital is a concern: high debtor days (≈161 days) and loyalty provisions create receivables/other‑liabilities pressure; monitor collection trends as expansion into new states may enlarge WC needs.  
- No interest burden and strong liquidity justify a high but not perfect score.

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Valuation Metrics | Current | Peer Avg | Historical / Median |
|-------------------|---------|----------|--------------------|
| P/E Ratio | 21.1x | 32.6x (peer median) | 22.2x (median PE 365d) |
| P/B Ratio | 6.68x | 3.5x (peer median) | 7.8x (median PBV 365d) |
| EV/EBITDA | 14.0x | 17.1x (peer median) | 14.0x (current) |
| Market Cap/Sales | 5.39x | -- | -- |
| PEG Ratio | -- | -- | -- |
| EV/Sales | -- | -- | -- |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Current P/E (~21x) is in line with the company’s high ROE/ROCE and below many larger peers on a growth‑adjusted basis; EV/EBITDA ~14x is modest relative to peer median ~17x.  
- Price/Book is elevated (6.7x) given strong ROE and expected ROCE sustainability; premium partly explained by superior margins and low capital intensity.  
- Valuation is not cheap in absolute terms, but relative to the company’s return profile and net‑cash balance sheet it is reasonable — downside is the sizeable receivables and loyalty liabilities that could compress near‑term FCF if redemption dynamics change.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Key Metrics | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROE | 37.4% |
| ROCE | 50.0% |
| Revenue Growth (3Y CAGR) | 16% |
| Revenue Growth (5Y CAGR) | 31% |
| FY25 Revenue | ₹284.1 Cr |
| Planned CapEx | ₹30–35 Cr (FY26–FY27 guidance) |
| Brownfield CapEx (near-term) | <₹10 Cr (1,500 T/month) |
| CAPEX/Revenue (proforma) | ~10–12% (planned) |
| Dividend Payout | ~15% |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Historical revenue/earnings CAGRs are strong; management targets 20–25% volume CAGR over FY24–FY27 and has credible capacity plans (brownfield + potential greenfield).  
- Brownfield expansion can materially lift capacity utilization and revenues (management cites potential to reach ₹500–650 Cr at higher utilization post expansions).  
- Asset‑light distribution expansion and a loyalty program can accelerate share gain in new states, but realization takes time (3+ years to mature a state).  
- High margins (GPM ~70% and EBITDA margin ~30% recently) create room to absorb A&P and still grow profitably — supports robust growth potential score.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Management Quality | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------|
| Concall Frequency | Frequent (multiple concalls & investor presentations per year) |
| Strategic Vision Clarity | Clear |
| Management Communication | High |
| Governance Score | 7/10 |
| Transparency Rating | Medium-High |

| Corporate Actions | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| Dividend Yield | ~0.7% |
| Dividend History | Consistent payout; FY25 final ₹9/share (~15% payout) |
| Recent Buyback | None |
| Capital Allocation Efficiency | Debt-free policy; internal funding for capex |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Management demonstrates transparency via regular investor presentations and detailed conference‑call disclosures; they proactively explain loyalty accounting and FD treatment.  
- Promoter family runs the business and has steadily increased focus on brand/distribution — promoter stake stable (~50.8%) and no pledge.  
- Areas to monitor: clarity on loyalty‑program accounting (timing of redemptions) and differentiation of trade vs. brand spends in disclosures — management has committed to better disclosure.  
- No material governance red flags observed; corporate actions (bonus in 2022, steady dividends) are shareholder friendly.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Research Metrics | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Notable Broker Report | CD Equisearch: BUY, TP ₹1,764 |
| Current Price | ₹1,277 |
| Upside (broker TP) | ~+38% |
| Buy Recommendations | 1 |
| Hold Recommendations | 0 |
| Sell Recommendations | 0 |
| Consensus Rating | Buy (limited coverage) |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Limited but constructive institutional coverage; recent broker models (example: target ₹1,764 using FY27E multiple) support valuation upside based on capacity expansion and re‑rating.  
- Reports highlight strong ROE/ROCE, net cash and execution of distribution/branding as key positives.  
- Coverage is still shallow relative to larger peers; more analyst coverage would strengthen the investability case.

#### Technical Analysis & Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Period | Return | vs Nifty |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 Month | -10% | (underperformance) |
| 3 Month | -7% | (underperformance) |
| 6 Month | +2% | (in-line/modest) |
| 1 Year | -15% | (underperformance) |

| Technical Indicators | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| 50‑DMA | ₹1,343.73 |
| 200‑DMA | ₹1,341.30 |
| Price vs 50/200 DMA | Below both (bearish near-term) |
| Volume Trend | Mixed with periodic spikes |

| Market Sentiment & Near-term Events | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| News Sentiment | Positive (brand push, capacity expansion) |
| Social Media Buzz | Moderate (national campaign + celebrity) |
| Options Activity | Neutral/Not conclusive |
| Upcoming Events | Q2/Q3 results, investor conferences, rollout of A&P campaign |
| Short-term Catalysts | Quarterly performance, capacity commissioning, early traction in new states |
| Near-term Risks | Seasonal demand, working‑capital swings, any sharp jump in VAM prices |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Price has corrected from highs and sits below both 50/200 DMAs — short‑term technical bias is cautious.  
- Volume shows episodic institutional interest (spikes around results); sentiment improves with visible brand investments and investor outreach.  
- Technicals do not negate fundamental strength but suggest entering on staged buys / dips rather than all‑in at current levels.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 7/10

| Shareholding Pattern | Current % | Previous % | Change |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Promoter Holding | 50.83% | ~50.8% (stable) | ~0% |
| FII Holding | 0.08% | 0.33% (peak) | Small |
| DII Holding | 1.22% | 0.07% (earlier) | +1.15% |
| Public Holding | 47.87% | ~48.3% | Slight ↓ |
| Pledged Shares | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0% |

| Sentiment Indicators | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Quality Investors | Limited marquee FI ownership; growing institutional interest observed |
| Recent Changes | Promoter holding steady; DIIs gradually increasing exposure |
| News Sentiment | Neutral to Positive |
| Options Activity | Neutral |

**Score Reasoning:**  
- Strong promoter commitment and zero pledge are positive. Institutional ownership is small but showing early signs of interest; marquee long‑only funds not yet materially present.  
- A high retail/public float (~48%) provides liquidity for re‑rating, but institutional anchor is desirable for sustained rerating.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Comparison Aspect | Assessment | Explanation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Valuation vs. Peers** | Discount on EV/EBITDA, Premium on PBV | EV/EBITDA ~14x (below peer median ~17x) but P/BV higher (~6.7x) because of superior ROE; P/E lower than some large branded peers. |
| **Performance vs. Peers** | Superior returns (ROE/ROCE) | ROE ~37%, ROCE ~50% materially higher than peer median — demonstrates operating leverage and premium margins despite smaller scale. |

## Key Strengths
- Debt‑free balance sheet with substantial cash & FDs (provides funding flexibility for capex & brand spends).  
- High operating profitability (GPM ~70%, EBITDA margin ~30%) and best‑in‑class ROCE/ROE.  
- Scalable distribution network + a large, data-enabled carpenter loyalty ecosystem (competitive moat in B2C trade).  
- Clear, staged capex plan (low near‑term brownfield capex) that is internally fundable.  
- Strong historical revenue & profit CAGRs — capability to execute past scaling phases.

## Key Concerns  
- High debtor days (≈161 days) and large loyalty‑related other liabilities require close monitoring; risk to FCF if redemptions accelerate.  
- Expansion execution risk: new states take time to mature; ramp may be slower than guidance.  
- Raw material (VAM) price volatility — imported input can compress margins if spikes occur.  
- Valuation is not inexpensive on PBV basis; market pricing requires continued execution.  
- Institutional investor base still shallow — rerating may need broader institutional participation.

## Scenario Analysis

### Bull Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Revenue CAGR FY25–FY27 ~30% (faster than guidance), capacity expansion (brownfield + early greenfield) completed on schedule; premium product mix rises to 40% of sales; EBITDA margin sustains ~30–32%; FY27 EPS ≈ ₹90. |
| **Valuation Multiple** | Re-rating to 24x FY27E EPS on improved scale, institutional flows and lower perceived execution risk. |
| **Catalysts** | Smooth brownfield commissioning, visible market share gains in UP/Delhi, strong loyalty redemption economics, controlled receivables, positive macro for construction. |
| **Target Price** | ₹2,160 (₹90 EPS × 24x) |
| **Return vs CMP** | +69% |
| **Probability** | 20% |
| **Justification** | High growth + margin sustainability with successful brand campaign could trigger multiple expansion; however execution risk in new geographies limits probability.

### Base Case Scenario (Most Likely)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Management guidance broadly met: volume CAGR ~20% (FY25–FY27), revenue ~₹400–450 Cr by FY27; EBITDA margin normalises at ~27–30% as A&P steps up; FY27 EPS ≈ ₹80. |
| **Valuation Multiple** | Market assigns 22x on FY27E EPS (peer‑adjusted, reflects growth premium). |
| **Execution Milestones** | Brownfield capex (1,500 T/month) delivered; steady dealer rollouts; receivable days trend stable or modestly improving; loyalty program funding remains adequate (FDs). |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,764 (₹80 EPS × 22x) |
| **Return vs CMP** | +38% |
| **Probability** | 55% |
| **Justification** | Company has track record of execution, robust margins and net cash — base case (meeting guidance) is the most likely outcome.

### Bear Case Scenario

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Assumptions** | Demand softness and sharper raw‑material cost inflation; loyalty redemptions accelerate and working capital tightens; volume growth slows to ~8–10% CAGR; EBITDA margin contracts to ~18–20%; FY27 EPS compresses to ≈ ₹50. |
| **Valuation Multiple** | Multiple compresses to 14x (due to margin risk and elevated WC); investor sentiment weakens. |
| **Risk Factors** | Sharp VAM price spike, slower-than-expected adoption in new states, sudden increase in loyalty redemptions, reduction in institutional appetite. |
| **Target Price** | ₹700 (₹50 EPS × 14x) |
| **Return vs CMP** | -45% |
| **Probability** | 25% |
| **Justification** | Execution or commodity shocks could materially reduce cash generation and re‑rating; given net cash and product positioning, worst case is possible but less likely.

### Scenario Summary — Probability‑weighted Expected Return

| Scenario | Return vs CMP | Target Price | Probability | Weighted Return |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Bull Case | +69.2% | ₹2,160 | 20% | +13.8% |
| Base Case | +38.2% | ₹1,764 | 55% | +21.0% |
| Bear Case | -45.2% | ₹700 | 25% | -11.3% |
| **Expected Return** | | | **100%** | **+23.5%** |

Probability‑weighted expected return calculation:  
0.20 × (+69.2%) + 0.55 × (+38.2%) + 0.25 × (−45.2%) = +23.5% over 12 months.

Most Likely Scenario: Base Case (55%) — Evidence: management has consistently delivered volume and margin improvements historically, balance sheet is net cash, and near‑term brownfield capex is modest & internally funded. Execution risk exists (new states + working capital) but base guidance is credible.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| **RECOMMENDATION** | STRONG BUY |
| **Strategy Type** | Staggered accumulation (Buy on dips / Staggered Buy) |
| **Entry Price Range** | ₹1,150 - ₹1,350 |
| **Stop Loss** | ₹900 (for tactical positions) |
| **Target Price** | ₹1,764 (12 months) — base case; upside to ₹2,160 in bull case |
| **Position Size** | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) for core accumulation; small for highly concentrated portfolios |
| **Timeline** | 12 months (primary); 24–36 months for full realization of capacity-driven growth |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**  
- Probability‑weighted expected return ≈ +23.5% (12 months) — exceeds the STRONG BUY threshold (≥20%).  
- Debt‑free, cash‑rich balance sheet and industry‑leading ROCE/ROE provide downside protection compared with growth peers.  
- Clear, credible growth plan (brownfield + phased greenfield), supported by distribution expansion and an active loyalty program that increases repeat purchases.  
- Valuation appears fair relative to growth and returns (EV/EBITDA below peer median) despite elevated PBV; potential for multiple expansion if execution is smooth.  
- Risks (debtors, loyalty liabilities, VAM volatility) are material but manageable given cash buffer and conservative near‑term capex.

## Investment Thesis
1. Jyoti Resins combines a high‑margin, high‑ROCE business model with a net‑cash balance sheet — enabling high‑quality organic growth without leverage.  
2. The company’s staged capacity additions (low near‑term brownfield capex) and wide dealer/carpenter reach make the 20–25% volume guidance achievable if execution is steady.  
3. Brand investments (national ambassador + A&P) and a data‑driven loyalty platform can accelerate penetration in large states (UP, Delhi) and lift premium mix.  
4. Main risks are working‑capital (high receivables) and commodity exposure (VAM); both are monitorable and management is addressing these (warehouse, collection focus).  
5. Probability‑weighted return >20% with a balanced risk profile supports a STRONG BUY with a staged accumulation approach and clear stop‑loss discipline.
