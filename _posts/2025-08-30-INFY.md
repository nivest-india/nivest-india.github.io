### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Infosys Ltd (INFY) |
| **Sector** | Information Technology (IT Services) |
| **Current Price** | ₹1,470 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹6,10,526 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview

- Global IT services remains a secular growth industry (management / investor presentation guidance: global IT services market expanding ~8-9% CAGR) driven by digital transformation, cloud migration and now accelerated adoption of Generative AI.
- Indian large-cap IT players (TCS, Infosys, HCL, Wipro, LTIMindtree) compete on large-deal wins, digital/IP-led services and margin delivery; vendor consolidation is ongoing and favors scale + IP.
- Demand is bifurcated: resilient cost-transformation and cloud/AI projects, while discretionary spending (new product development, R&D) is softer — creating cyclical revenue risk in the near term.
- Currency, geopolitics and tariff/regulatory moves in developed markets (US/EU) remain the primary macro downside risks for Indian IT exports.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global IT services CAGR (industry) | ~8-9% |
| Infosys digital services share | ~57% of revenues |
| Geographic mix (Q1 FY26 investor deck) | North America ~56.5% / Europe ~31.5% / RoW ~9.1% / India ~2.9% |
| Key verticals (approx.) | Financial Services ~28-32% ; Retail ~13-15% ; Manufacturing ~11-16% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Strong secular tailwinds: AI, cloud and automation provide sustainable demand for transformation projects (positive structural drivers for the sector and Infosys specifically).
- Infosys is well positioned in higher-value digital services (management states ~57% digital), which command better margins vs legacy application maintenance.
- Sector is cyclically sensitive: discretionary/large transformation budgets have greater volatility; macro/tariff risk can materially slow top-line in the short term.
- Competitive but defensible: large global clients, consulting-led deals and IP (TOPAZ, Finacle, EdgeVerve) provide a differentiated value proposition versus mid-tier peers.
- Overall sector outlook favorable but with near-term cyclical headwinds — hence a high but not perfect score.

#### Financial Strength: 9/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sales (TTM) | ₹165,954 Cr |
| Net profit (TTM) | ₹27,300 Cr |
| Operating margin (TTM) | ~24% |
| Cash & investments (Q4 FY25 fact sheet) | ₹47,549 Cr |
| Borrowings (Mar 2025) | ₹8,227 Cr |
| Debt / Equity | 0.09 |
| Free cash flow (recent) | ₹33,457 Cr (reported FCF figure) |
| ROE / ROCE | ROE ~28.8% / ROCE ~37.5% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Exceptional cash generation and liquidity: large cash + investments (₹47,549 Cr) vs modest borrowings (₹8,227 Cr) -> net cash cushion ~₹39k Cr; supports buybacks, dividends and M&A optionality.
- High capital efficiency: ROE ~29% and ROCE ~38% indicate strong returns on invested capital across business cycles.
- Healthy margins and stable profitability: OPM ~24% (TTM) and consistent net margins; strong interest coverage (int coverage ~93x).
- Conservative balance sheet: low leverage (D/E 0.09) reduces financial risk and increases resilience in a slowdown.
- Working-capital metrics are reasonable (Debtor days ~70; C.C.C ~70 days), and cash-conversion remains strong (high FCF relative to PAT).

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P/E (TTM) | 22.4x |
| Price / Book (P/BV) | 6.43x |
| EV / EBITDA | 13.6x |
| Dividend yield | 2.9% |
| Median sector P/E (peer set) | ~29.6x (median shown in peer data) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Relative to its own history and high-quality peers, Infosys is trading at a moderate valuation — P/E ~22.4x which is below some historical ranges and below peer median in datasets (gives valuation support).
- P/B remains elevated (~6.4x) because of strong ROE (capital-light model generates high book-value multiples).
- EV/EBITDA (~13.6x) is within peer ranges — not cheap enough to be an obvious deep value pick, but reasonable given cash generation and ROIC.
- Dividend yield and high payout (~66.7%) provide income support; buybacks announced/executed in FY25 enhance returns.
- Overall: fair valuation for a high-quality cash-generative franchise; not deeply cheap, so upside depends on multiple re-rating or improved growth/margins.

#### Growth Potential: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sales CAGR (5 yr) | ~12.4% |
| EPS growth (5 yr) | ~10.6% |
| Large‑deal TCV (FY) | Company decks report multi‑bn USD TCV (large‑deal pipeline) |
| Management guidance (near term) | FY26: low‑to‑mid single digit CC growth (company/brokers) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Structural growth via digital, cloud and AI is meaningful — management targets AI-enabled revenue share increases (management commentary: goal ~30% AI-enabled revenue by FY28).
- Historical revenue/EPS CAGRs are solid (5‑yr sales CAGR ~12%), but recent TTM growth has slowed (TTM growth ~7%); near-term organic growth guidance is conservative (mid-single digits).
- Large-deal pipeline provides upside if conversion and ramp-ups occur — this is the primary growth lever; execution risk remains (book-to-bill below peak in some quarters).
- Margin expansion via automation/AI could boost EPS without massive revenue growth, but wage inflation and passthrough dynamics are offsetting factors.
- Overall growth outlook is steady and credible (high quality), but not high single-digit/high‑teens growth in the base case — hence a mid score.

#### Corporate Governance: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding | ~14.6% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.00% |
| Dividend payout (recent) | ~66.7% |
| Share buybacks (recent) | Large buyback executed in FY25 (management disclosures) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- High governance standards and transparency: consistent reporting, regular investor presentations, wide analyst coverage; management communicates actions (guidance, buybacks, capital return).
- Shareholder returns are a priority: high payout ratio and large buybacks (FY25), indicating shareholder-friendly capital allocation.
- Promoter stake is significant but dispersed among founding family and senior founders — alignment exists without dominance issues; no pledge.
- Board & management track record: stable senior team and proactive strategy (AI, acquisitions). A legal dispute (trade-secret allegation from a competitor) exists — increases vigilance but not a governance breach to date.
- Overall strong governance credentials relative to peers.

#### Research Reports: 7/10

| Broker | Date | Call / TP |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Prabhudas Lilladher | 21-Apr-2025 | BUY — TP ~₹1,630 |
| Emkay | 18-Apr-2025 | BUY — TP ~₹1,650 |
| Deven Choksey | 24-Jul-2025 | BUY — TP ~₹1,830 |
| Motilal Oswal | 23-Jul-2025 | NEUTRAL — TP ~₹1,750 |
| Prabhudas (Jul update) | 24-Jul-2025 | ACCUMULATE — TP ~₹1,750 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Heavy analyst coverage with a mix of BUY / ACCUMULATE / NEUTRAL calls; most reports in 2025 place 12–24 month TPs in the ₹1,600–1,850 range.
- Common broker thesis: margin resilience + AI/digital pivot + strong cash returns. Risks emphasized: soft discretionary demand, wage inflation, acquisition integration.
- Reports show modest upside in consensus (mid‑teens%) — supportive but not overly bullish.
- Availability of timely broker updates and company presentations improves visibility for investors.
- Rating reflects broad coverage and generally constructive (but cautious) analyst stance.

#### Technical Analysis: 4/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price (trendlyne / NSE) | ₹1,469.60 |
| 50‑DMA | ~₹1,520 |
| 200‑DMA | ~₹1,619 |
| RSI (14) | 44 (neutral) |
| MACD | Below center (bearish) |
| Key pivot supports | S1 ₹1,457 / S2 ₹1,445 / S3 ₹1,423 |
| Key resistances | R1 ₹1,491 / R2 ₹1,513 / R3 ₹1,526 |
| 52‑week fall from high | ~‑27% from ₹2,006 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is below 50‑ and 200‑day moving averages (trend weakness); Trendlyne signals trading below most SMAs/EMAs (bearish technical posture).
- Momentum indicators mixed-to-negative: RSI ~44 (neutral), MACD below center (negative), Stochastic/Rsi oscillators showing limited short-term bounce potential.
- Support cluster in the ₹1,420–1,460 zone — important for any tactical buying; resistance near ₹1,500–1,520 must be cleared for a trend reversal.
- Trading volumes show periods of heavy selling in the correction phase; price action remains vulnerable to market sentiment despite strong fundamentals.
- Technicals favor a wait/buy‑on‑dip approach rather than a breakout pick.

#### Market Sentiments: 5/10

| Sentiment factor | Recent signal |
|------------------|---------------|
| News flow | Mixed — AI pivot & buybacks positive ; softer demand / tariff risk and legal dispute negative |
| Broker stance | Mostly BUY / ACCUMULATE with cautious commentary |
| Macro (US Fed/FX) impact | Rate outlook + INR/USD volatility materially affects multiples and translation of USD revenues |
| Momentum in sector | Volatile — occasional sector rallies on rate hopes but structural demand softness persists |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Market reaction to earnings/guidance and macro cues (Fed / rate cut expectations) drives short-term volatility; recent sell-off reflects lower near-term growth visibility.
- Company-specific positives (TOPAZ/AI, buyback, dividend policy) moderate negative sentiment.
- Legal dispute (trade-secret allegation from a competitor) and slower discretionary spend have dented sentiment, though not systemic.
- Analyst coverage and capital returns keep a neutral-to-cautious investor stance.
- Sentiment is balanced; neither highly negative nor strongly positive.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 8/10

| Period | Promoters | FIIs | DIIs | Public |
|--------|-----------|------|------|--------|
| Jun 2025 | 14.61% | 31.92% | 39.39% | 13.62% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Promoter holding (~14.6%) provides alignment with founders involved; no pledge.
- Institutional ownership is high and high-quality: DIIs have increased (supportive), FIIs remain significant (~32%) with notable global funds (Government of Singapore, Vanguard, GPFG).
- Large mutual fund and LIC presence provides stability; recent DII accumulation (vs earlier periods) is a positive signal.
- Free float is adequate; top-25 clients concentration (revenue side) is a separate operational risk but not a shareholding issue.
- Overall institutional quality and promoter behaviour supportive of the stock.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (Rs.Cr.) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE% | EV / EBITDA |
|------|---------------------|-----:|---------:|-----:|------------:|
| TCS | ₹11,16,071 Cr | 22.65 | 11.78 | 52.4% | 15.36 |
| Infosys | ₹6,10,526 Cr | 22.39 | 6.43 | 28.8% | 13.59 |
| HCL Technologies | ₹3,94,784 Cr | 23.26 | 5.67 | 25.0% | 13.77 |
| Wipro | ₹2,61,465 Cr | 19.42 | 3.15 | 16.6% | 12.12 |
| LTIMindtree | ₹1,52,165 Cr | 32.25 | 6.70 | 21.5% | 19.60 |

- Infosys trades at a modest P/E similar to TCS but with a lower CMP/BV than TCS and higher ROE than most mid‑tier peers — positioning it as a high‑quality, cash‑generative franchise at a reasonable valuation vs history.
- EV/EBITDA for Infosys sits comfortably in the peer band; relative attractiveness depends on conviction around growth/margins.

## Key Strengths
- Strong cash generation and net cash balance (large cash & investments vs low borrowings).
- High capital efficiency: ROE ~29% and ROCE ~38%.
- Leading digital & AI capability (TOPAZ / EdgeVerve) and a large global client base with sizeable large‑deal pipeline.
- Shareholder-friendly capital allocation (high payout and sizeable buybacks executed/planned).
- Diversified end-market exposure with a strong position in Financial Services.

## Key Concerns  
- Near-term revenue cyclicality: discretionary spend remains soft — management guidance is cautious (mid-single-digit CC growth).
- Wage inflation and passthrough dynamics can compress margins if productivity levers underperform.
- Legal dispute / litigation risk (competitor trade-secret allegation) — watch for litigation outcomes.
- Technical momentum weak (price down ~27% from 52‑week high), increasing short-term market risk.
- Client concentration risk (top‑25 clients ~53% of revenue) — loss or slow ramp of a large client could impact growth.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,900 (24 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Successful monetization of AI/IP (TOPAZ) leading to margin expansion to ~22%+; large‑deal conversions accelerate (TCV ramp); multiple expansion to ~25–26x on stronger FY27–FY28 EPS (~₹74‑77) and continued shareholder returns (dividends + buybacks). Execution of acquisitions and cross-sell to large clients adds incremental revenue and higher margins.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,700 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management delivers on conservative guidance (FY26 mid-single-digit CC growth), margins improve modestly (50–100 bps) via automation and lower passthrough; FY27E EPS ~₹72; market values the stock at ~23x forward earnings → TP ≈ ₹1,700. This reflects consensus broker median and achievable execution.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,250 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Prolonged macro weakness or tariff-driven client slowdowns reduce organic growth (FY26 growth ~0%); wage inflation squeezes margins (no offsetting productivity); multiple compression to ~20x on lower EPS (~₹62) and market de‑rating; weaker investor sentiment drives the stock lower.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|---------------:|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹1,900 | +29.3% | Strong execution on AI/digital + multiple expansion |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹1,700 | +15.6% | Balanced delivery of guidance, modest margin improvement |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹1,250 | -14.9% | Execution / demand failure with multiple compression |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY — realistic scenario implies ≈+15.6% upside in 12 months, meeting the ≥15% upside threshold for a BUY call.
- **Risk-Reward Assessment:** Upside is mid‑teens assuming stable execution; downside is limited by balance-sheet strength and high institutional ownership but not negligible given near-term cyclical risk. Position sizing should reflect medium conviction with monitoring triggers (see entry/stop guidance).

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price | Position Size | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| BUY | Core‑long (value + yield) | Buy on dips ₹1,350 – ₹1,470 | ₹1,200 (hard stop) | ₹1,700 (12 months) | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Infosys is a high-quality, cash-generative IT leader with strong ROE/ROCE, large cash reserves and a shareholder-friendly capital return policy — these structural positives justify a core allocation.
- Realistic case (TP ₹1,700) shows >15% upside in 12 months given modest margin improvements and multiple stabilization — meets BUY criteria.
- Near-term risk (cyclical demand, wage pressure, legal matter) warrants cautious position sizing and a stop-loss; prefer staggered entry on weakness and re-evaluate after next two quarters of results.

## Investment Thesis
1. Infosys combines a high-quality balance sheet (net cash), strong cash conversion and disciplined capital returns (dividends + buybacks) — providing downside support even in cyclical markets.
2. The company’s shift to AI-led, IP-enabled services (TOPAZ, EdgeVerve) and focus on large‑deal wins offers durable margin and revenue upside, contingent on conversion/execution.
3. Valuation (~22x P/E) is reasonable relative to cash-flow strength and ROE profile; re-rating potential exists if growth/margins improve and large deals ramp.
4. Execution risk concentrates around client discretionary spend, wage inflation and successful integration of acquisitions — these are the key monitoring points.
5. Recommended action: accumulate on weakness for a medium-sized core position with a 12‑month view toward the realistic TP, while monitoring Q2/Q3 results and large‑deal conversion.
