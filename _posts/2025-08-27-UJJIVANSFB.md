### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Limited (UJJIVANSFB) |
| **Sector** | Banking / Small Finance Bank |
| **Current Price** | ₹42.8 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹8,283 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-27 |

### Industry Overview

- The company operates in the Small Finance Bank (SFB) segment focusing on financially underserved retail customers; the industry is in an active transition from high‑yield unsecured microfinance toward a higher share of secured retail lending (housing, vehicle, gold, MSME).
- Regulatory tailwinds in 2025 (example: lower Priority Sector Lending [PSL] requirement for SFBs and implementation of updated MFI guardrails) materially affect product mix and capital allocation choices for SFBs.
- Liability mobilization (retail term deposits + CASA) and cost of funds are key competitive levers; banks that build retail deposit franchises and CASA will see sustainable NIMs.
- Competition: several SFBs are scaling secured products rapidly (housing, vehicle, MSME) which compresses yields but improves asset quality; lenders with scalable liability engines and diversified products enjoy valuation premiums.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Industry Segment | Small Finance Banks / Mass-market retail banking |
| Ujjivan Loan Book (FY25) | ₹32,122 Cr |
| Secured book (FY25) | ~44% of loans (≈ ₹13,988 Cr) |
| Regulatory change (2025) | PSL relaxations for SFBs; Guardrails 2.0 in microfinance |
| Key structural trend | Shift from high-share group MFI to secured loans (housing, vehicle, gold) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- SFB sector fundamentals supportive: financial inclusion focus + strong retail demand across housing/MSME/vehicle segments provides long runway for growth.
- PSL relaxation reduces forced allocation pressure and allows better liability and asset calibration — positive for bank P&L and capital efficiency.
- Guardrails 2.0 and episodic state-level stress (Karnataka/Tamil Nadu) create near-term variability in microfinance performance; sector recovery timelines are uncertain.
- Product diversification into secured lending is the right structural response; banks that execute well gain both margin stability and credit quality improvements.
- Competitive intensity for retail deposits and secured loan segments increases execution risk and margins pressure for weaker deposit franchises.

#### Financial Strength: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CRAR (FY25) | 23.1% |
| GNPA / NNPA (FY25) | 2.2% / 0.5% |
| PCR (FY25) | 78% |
| Deposits (FY25) | ₹37,630 Cr |
| NIM (FY25) | 8.8% |
| Loan Book (FY25) | ₹32,122 Cr |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Capital adequacy is strong (CRAR ~23.1%) — provides buffer for portfolio normalization and growth without immediate equity raise.
- Asset quality improved vs earlier years (GNPA ~2.2%, NNPA ~0.5%) with PCR ~78% — indicates conservative provisioning and cleaned-up stressed buckets (including ARC sale in Jan 2025).
- Deposit franchise is healthy (total deposits ~₹37,630 Cr, CASA improving toward mid‑20% levels) which lowers reliance on costly borrowings; borrowings are moderate (~₹2,845 Cr).
- NIM is high by industry standards but is compressing as secured share rises (management guiding towards stabilized but lower NIM) — margin risk exists but funding cost tailwinds are expected to help.
- Profitability showed variability (PAT FY25 ~₹726 Cr vs previous years higher), reflecting transitional investment and elevated credit costs; cash flows and operating leverage need monitoring.

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price / Book (P/B) | 1.36 |
| Stock P/E (TTM) | 15.7 |
| Book Value per share | ₹31.4 |
| EV / EBITDA | 13.0 |
| Market Cap | ₹8,283 Cr |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Valuation sits in the mid‑range vs SFB peers: P/E ~15.7 and P/B ~1.36 compare to peer median P/E ~16 and median P/B ~1.2 — reasonably priced given growth and asset quality improvement.
- EV/EBITDA ~13.0 looks fair vs peers (median ~15.2) suggesting room for re-rating if earnings stabilize and credit costs normalize.
- The bank’s higher NIM and improving ROE (ROE ~12.4% FY25) support a modest premium; however secular shift to secured lending may compress NIMs relative to historical highs.
- Current price implies a modest rerating is possible if management executes secured book scale-up and cost efficiencies; downside exists if GNPA/inflation surprises.
- Valuation attractiveness is conditional on execution risk — hence neutral‑positive.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY25 Advances | ₹32,122 Cr |
| Secured book growth (YoY FY25) | ~+56% (secured products) |
| Disbursements (Q4 FY25) | ₹7,440 Cr (all‑time high) |
| Management FY26 guidance | Advances ~20%; Secured book ~+35% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Clear strategic pivot to secured products (affordable housing, micro‑mortgages, vehicle, gold) which grew rapidly in FY25 — this materially increases addressable market and risk‑adjusted returns.
- Management targets high‑teens/20% loan growth and rapid secured book scale; execution so far (Q4 disbursements, Q1 FY26 early traction) supports feasibility.
- Liability strategy (push for CASA and retail term deposits) and product innovations (digital onboarding, UPI/Hello Ujjivan) improve cost of funds and distribution scalability.
- Universal bank application (filed Feb 2025) is a structural optionality — if approved, it broadens product set and distribution levers (but approval timing is uncertain).
- Growth is balanced by execution risk in microfinance collections in select geographies; however diversification into secured assets reduces tail risk long‑term.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Management changes (2024) | New MD & CEO appointed Jul 2024 (S. Nautiyal) |
| Reverse merger | Completed May 2024 (UFSL -> Bank) |
| Dividend policy FY25 | Nil payout (earlier years saw payouts) |
| Promoter holding (latest) | 0.0% (post reverse-merger / change in listed structure) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Board/management refresh in 2024 brought industry experience into the top team — management has been proactive in investor communications (frequent concalls and disclosures).
- Reverse merger completed in May 2024 and subsequent structural changes increased free float and institutional ownership — improves liquidity but alters promoter dynamics.
- No material corporate governance red flags publicly visible; capital allocation actions (ARC sale, calibrated write‑offs) show active balance‑sheet management.
- Promoter stake reported at ~0% (post‑restructuring) increases the need for transparent minority‑shareholder protections and consistent external oversight.
- Dividend payout has been inconsistent (payout in 2023, nil in FY25) aligned to capital conservation — acceptable if clearly communicated.

#### Research Reports: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Analyst coverage | Limited / mixed in past 12 months |
| Recent broker notes | Some short‑term buy calls reported (May 2025) |
| Broker target range seen (public media) | Indicative mid‑range targets near ₹50–70 (varied) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Analyst coverage is present but not broad; recent broker commentary is mixed — some short‑term positive calls after Q4 FY25 results while others emphasize microfinance stress risks.
- Lack of consistent, high‑conviction published research across multiple brokers makes consensus estimates volatile; recent work has updated models for secured book ramp.
- Management guidance and transparent concalls have improved the quality of sell‑side modeling inputs, but some broker reports flagged asset quality uncertainty in specific states.
- In the absence of a deep and stable sell‑side consensus, investor reliance must be on bank filings, concall information, and independent modelling.
- Recommendation: monitor top 2–3 broker updates after upcoming quarters for clearer earnings re‑rating triggers.

#### Technical Analysis: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | ₹42.8 |
| 50‑DMA | ~₹44.7 |
| 200‑DMA | ~₹42.6 |
| 52‑week High / Low | ₹51.9 / ₹30.8 |
| Recent volatility | Elevated (June–July 2025 spike to ₹51, subsequent retracement) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is trading slightly below the 50‑day moving average and marginally above the 200‑day average — neutral/indecisive technical posture.
- Sharp runs in June 2025 (peak ~₹51) followed by profit‑taking signal heightened investor interest but also increased volatility and short‑term risk.
- Volume spikes on select sessions indicate active institutional participation (both accumulation and distribution days).
- Support exists near the 200‑DMA (~₹42.6) and prior lows (~₹31), but failure to reclaim 50‑DMA decisively would signal further consolidation.
- For traders, risk management (stops, position sizing) important given macro‑sensitivity of banking names to rates and credit news.

#### Market Sentiments: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Recent corporate news | Universal bank application (Feb 2025); ARC sale of stressed loans (Jan 2025) |
| Broker headlines | Mixed; some buy calls post earnings (May 2025) |
| Media tone | Cautious‑positive: structural pivot recognized but regional MFI stress noted |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Positive catalysts: visible secured book ramp, universal bank application, institutional investor participation (IFC and foreign funds reported).
- Negative/uncertain catalysts: legacy microfinance stress in some states (Karnataka/Tamil Nadu), temporary NIM compression from product mix change, and near‑term credit costs.
- Overall sentiment has shifted from panic in earlier stress years to cautious optimism as management demonstrates cleanup and diversification.
- Market reaction has been volatile — investors reward execution (disbursement momentum and collection stability) and punish worsening slippages quickly.
- Short‑term market sentiment will remain tied to quarterly collection metrics and RBI/regulatory developments.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding (latest) | 0.00% (post restructuring) |
| FIIs (Jun 2025) | ~19.55% |
| DIIs (Jun 2025) | ~16.82% |
| Public float (Jun 2025) | ~63.61% |
| Notable institutional holders | International Finance Corporation (~3.21%), Duro One (~1.67%), Bowhead India (~1.59%), select mutual funds |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Institutional participation (IFC, global funds, domestic mutual funds) is a positive signal for governance and credit assessment standards.
- Promoter stake reported as zero post‑restructuring alters the governance dynamics — increased public float improves liquidity but reduces a single long‑term promoter anchor.
- Retail/public shareholding is high which can result in higher stock liquidity but also higher volatility on news flow.
- Presence of marquee FIIs provides confidence about institutional due diligence; DIIs rising over last quarters indicates domestic fund interest.
- Watch for changes in major investor stakes (inflows/outflows) as a sentiment and re‑rating indicator.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE % |
|------|--------------------|-----:|---------:|------:|
| AU Small Finance | ₹55,569.7 Cr | 25.4 | 3.23 | 14.2% |
| Ujjivan SFB | ₹8,283 Cr | 15.7 | 1.36 | 12.4% |
| Equitas SFB | ₹5,957.7 Cr | — | 0.98 | 2.4% |
| Jana SFB | ₹5,177.7 Cr | 11.96 | 1.26 | 13.0% |

- Ujjivan trades at a valuation discount to larger SFBs like AU (P/B and P/E lower) but a premium to some smaller peers; ROE is competitive given ongoing transition.

## Key Strengths
- Strong retail deposit franchise (₹37,630 Cr deposits; rising CASA) improving liability mix and lowering funding cost risk.
- High capital adequacy (CRAR ~23.1%), enabling growth and absorption of near‑term stress.
- Rapid and credible shift toward secured lending (housing, micro mortgage, vehicle, gold) diversifies asset risk and supports long‑term ROA stability.
- Institutional investors (IFC, global funds) present on register — a vote of confidence on governance and credit assessment.
- Transparent investor communication and frequent concalls allow better visibility for modeling (universal bank application is positive optionality).

## Key Concerns
- Residual microfinance stress in select states (Karnataka / Tamil Nadu) can cause episodic credit costs and slower than guided recovery.
- NIM compression risk as secured share rises — management expects partially offsetting effects but downside is possible.
- Promoter stake / structure changes post reverse‑merger reduce a single promoter anchor; this requires continued transparency.
- Short‑term earnings volatility due to provisioning swings, ARC sales and one‑offs require careful earnings quality assessment.
- Execution risk in scaling newer secured products (dealer networks for vehicle finance, underwriting in housing) while maintaining portfolio quality.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹66 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Strong execution on secured book ramp (housing/MSME/vehicle/gold), NIM stabilises close to 8.0% as cost of funds falls, credit costs normalize below 1.5% annually, universal bank optionality progresses (positive investor re‑rating), multiple expansion to P/B ~2.1 driven by improved ROE and visible earnings CAGR.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹50 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Secured book growth ~30–35% driving steady fee and interest income, NIM stabilizes ~7.8–8.0% with cost‑of‑fund tailwinds, credit cost normalizes to management guidance (2.3–2.4% FY26 annualized) and PCR maintained ~75–80%, modest multiple re‑rating to P/B ~1.6 as risk perception improves.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹28 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Regional MFI stress persists / deteriorates causing slippages above guidance, credit cost surprise and higher provisions, NIM contraction due to aggressive competition for deposits, multiple compression to P/B ~0.9 (market assigns higher risk premium).

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------:|--------------:|---------------------|
| Optimistic | ₹66 | +54% | Strong upside if secured ramp + re‑rating |
| Realistic | ₹50 | +17% | Most likely based on management guidance & execution — meets BUY threshold (≥15%) |
| Pessimistic | ₹28 | -34% | Significant downside if asset quality shocks recur |

Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:
- Primary Recommendation: BUY (realistic scenario shows ~+17% upside vs current price ₹42.8; exceeds 15% threshold).
- Risk‑Reward Assessment: Upside (~+17%) is modest but acceptable for investors looking for a 12‑month structural recovery; downside material (-34%) if asset quality deteriorates — position sizing and stop losses are critical.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price (Realistic) | Position Size | Time Horizon |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------:|----------:|-------------------------:|--------------:|-------------:|
| BUY | Core / Accumulate on Dips | ₹38 – ₹44 | ₹33 (≈ -23% from CMP) | ₹50 (12 months) | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Bank has strong capital (CRAR ~23%), improving asset quality and a credible plan to diversify into secured lending (reduces long‑term credit tail risk).
- Valuation is reasonable relative to peers; modest re‑rating possible as earnings normalize and credit costs decline.
- Primary risks (regional MFI stress, NIM compression) are visible and quantifiable — recommend accumulation on dips with disciplined stops and portfolio position sizing as above.
- For higher conviction, wait for sequential quarters showing sustained collection improvement and NIM stabilization.

## Investment Thesis

1. Ujjivan is transitioning to a higher‑quality loan mix (44% secured loans in FY25) while maintaining a strong liability franchise — this combination should drive better risk‑adjusted returns over 12–24 months.
2. Strong capital cushion (CRAR ~23.1%) and conservative provisioning (PCR ~78%) reduce tail risk and allow controlled growth without immediate capital raises.
3. Universal bank application (filed Feb 2025) is meaningful optionality — approval would enhance product distribution, liability products and fee income potential (timeline uncertain).
4. Valuation is reasonable (P/B ~1.36, P/E ~15.7) vs peers; scope for modest rerating if earnings visibility improves and GNPA trends remain stable.
5. Key risks (geography‑specific MFI stress, NIM compression) are manageable but material — execution and quarterly collection metrics should be monitored closely; use dip accumulation and strict stop loss discipline.
