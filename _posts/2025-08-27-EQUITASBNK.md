### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | Equitas Small Finance Bank Ltd (EQUITASBNK) |
| **Sector** | Banking |
| **Current Price** | ₹52.24 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹5,958 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-27 |

### Industry Overview
- Indian small‑finance banks and retail‑focused lenders continue to address the structural credit gap for small businesses, affordable housing and vehicle finance; growth is driven by financial inclusion and formalisation of MSME credit.
- Microfinance (MFI) remains the most volatile sub‑segment: recent regulatory guardrails and state ordinances (Karnataka/Tamil Nadu episodes) compress short‑term volumes/collections but improve long‑term discipline.
- Deposit mobilisation (retail CASA growth) and liability diversification (FCNR, NRE, NRI deposits) are the primary levers for margin recovery in SFBs as cost of funds normalises.
- Competitive intensity from NBFCs and fintechs for unsecured products remains high; banks with a stronger secured portfolio and branch + digital reach have an advantage.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 7/10

| Metric | Equitas / Industry Context |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Equitas P/BV | 0.98 × |
| Industry (SFB) median P/BV | 1.6 × (median peers) |
| Industry median ROE | ~10.4% (peer median) |
| MFI share (Equitas Jun'25) | ~9–12% of book (management guidance/decline) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- India retail credit remains structurally attractive (SME, affordable housing, vehicle finance), supporting long‑term demand for SFBs; Equitas is positioned in these segments → positive.
- MFI guardrails and regulatory scrutiny increase short‑term volatility for banks with meaningful MFI exposure; Equitas is actively de‑risking MFI which reduces structural tail‑risk but lowers near‑term yield → mixed.
- Sector valuation median (P/B ~1.6) is meaningfully higher than Equitas’ P/B (~0.98), indicating sector appetite for quality SFBs but also a re‑rating opportunity if Equitas stabilises → neutral‑to‑positive.
- Competitive pressure from NBFCs/fintech for unsecured products; banks that broaden secured portfolio (Small Business Loans, Housing, Used Vehicles) are better placed — aligns with Equitas’ strategy.
- Macro and interest‑rate cycles (cost of funds) will materially affect SFB margin trajectories — industry outlook moderately favorable but sensitive to rate moves.

#### Financial Strength: 5/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deposits (Mar'25) | ₹43,107 Cr |
| Gross Advances (Jun'25) | ₹37,610 Cr |
| CRAR (Jun'25) | ~20.5% |
| GNPA (Jun'25) | ~2.8% |
| NNPA (Jun'25) | ~0.95% |
| PCR | ~67% |
| TTM PAT | ₹-102 Cr (TTM) |
| Book Value (Aug'25) | ₹53.3 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Liquidity & franchise: Deposit franchise is strong (₹43,107 Cr) with CASA ~29% (improving retail stickiness) — this supports funding and is a structural strength.
- Capital adequacy: CRAR ~20.5% (post Tier‑2 / planned Tier‑1 actions) provides capital headroom for growth — positive buffer vs regulatory thresholds.
- Asset quality: GNPA ~2.8% and PCR ~67% — manageable with adequate coverage, though MFI caused elevated provisions in the recent quarter.
- Profitability stress: TTM PAT turned negative (TTM PAT -₹102 Cr) primarily due to upfront provisioning in Q1 FY26 (management overlay) — this weakens financial strength in the near term.
- Leverage/efficiency: RoE/ROA are depressed (ROE ~2.4% last reported), indicating earnings generation needs recovery; balance sheet resilient but earnings profile is under stress.

#### Valuations: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current P/BV | 0.98 × |
| Book Value (Aug'25) | ₹53.3 |
| Current P/E | Not meaningful (negative TTM EPS) |
| EV/EBITDA (indicative) | 15.0 × (metric shown) |
| Peer median P/BV | 1.6 × |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Equity is trading below book (P/B ~0.98), which embeds earnings risk but offers potential upside on normalization — valuation looks cheap vs peers.
- P/E not meaningful due to negative TTM earnings; hence P/B / ABV is the primary valuation anchor for a bank in turnaround.
- Peer comparison shows meaningful re‑rating potential if ROE recovers (peers trade at higher P/B and ROE ~10%+).
- Broker research shows a range of TPs (₹55–80) reflecting divergent views; a conservative base ABV multiple expansion to ~1.1–1.2× yields the realistic target.
- Risk premium remains elevated (due to MFI stress & provisioning), limiting near‑term re‑rating until earnings clarity returns.

#### Growth Potential: 7/10

| Metric | Value / Guidance |
|--------|------------------|
| FY26 Advance Growth Guidance | 15–16% (management) |
| Secured book share | ~90% of advances (management stated) |
| MFI share (trend) | Declining to mid‑single digits (target) |
| Fee & other income | Other income trends elevated via treasury in Q1 FY26 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management guidance: 15–16% advance growth for FY26 focused on secured segments (SBL, housing, vehicle) — credible given branch and deposit traction.
- Product mix: Shift to secured lending and digital products (self‑loan app, credit cards, AD1 forex/NR banking) provides higher‑quality growth levers.
- Liability side: Retail deposit expansion and CASA stability support low cost funding — helps scale without excessive wholesale borrowings.
- Execution risk: Growth in used‑vehicle, housing and SBL requires continued underwriting discipline; Equitas’ controlled de‑risking of MFI improves long‑term growth quality.
- Timeline: Growth potential is above average for SFBs, but near‑term growth will be capped by capital / provisioning dynamics.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Board / KMP updates | New Part‑time Chairman appointment Apr'24; tech leadership churn noted |
| Capital actions | Proactive Tier‑2 NCD raise (₹500 Cr) & Board‑approved Tier‑1 raise (₹1,250 Cr) |
| Provisioning stance | Management front‑loaded provisions for MFI (transparent) |
| Shareholder returns | Dividend payout historically variable; recent payout policy inconsistent with earnings stress |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Management transparency: Clear, consistent communication (concall disclosures of provisioning strategy, MFI de‑risking) demonstrates proactive governance.
- Capital planning: Timely capital instruments (NCDs, planned Tier‑1) show preparedness and dialogue with markets — positive governance action.
- Accountability: Upfront provisioning and explicit guidance (ROA/ROE targets) reflect conservative risk management choices.
- Minor concerns: Higher dividend payout in prior years despite cyclical risk may merit attention; recent loss reduces scope for shareholder returns.
- Overall: Management appears competent and pragmatic in the cycle; governance quality is acceptable for a bank undergoing transition.

#### Research Reports: 8/10

| Broker | Recent Stance / TP |
|--------|--------------------|
| Motilal Oswal | BUY; TPs in range ₹70–80 (various notes in 2025) |
| ICICI Securities | HOLD; TP ₹57 (post results) |
| Emkay | REDUCE; TP ₹55 (post results) |
| Others | Multiple reports in 2025 showing divergent views |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Coverage depth: Heavy broker coverage in 2025 (Motilal Oswal, ICICI, Emkay and others) — investors can access multiple scenario analyses.
- Consensus divergence: Analysts differ (BUY/HOLD/REDUCE) — reflects execution and asset‑quality risk uncertainty.
- Useful detail: Broker reports provide ABV/P/E scenarios and sensitivity to credit cost — valuable for scenario modelling.
- Timeliness: Research was updated following the Q1 FY26 loss and management’s provisioning — shows active monitoring.
- Actionable research: Reports provide concrete TPs and rationales; readability and consistency are high.

#### Technical Analysis: 3/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | ₹52.24 |
| 50 DMA | ~₹59.4 |
| 200 DMA | ~₹65.5 |
| Momentum (RSI 14) | 28.3 (oversold) |
| Price trend (1Y) | Down ~36% from 52‑week high |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is trading below all major moving averages (negative technical backdrop) and has made new 52‑week lows recently — short‑term technicals are weak.
- Oscillators (MACD, Stochastic) are bearish; momentum is negative — trend is down until price reclaims key moving averages.
- RSI oversold suggests a tactical bounce is possible, but trend confirmation requires stabilisation above 50‑DMA and recovery in volume.
- Volume profile: average volumes adequate, but distribution and moments of heavy selling have pressured price.
- Technicals weigh against short‑term buying; best used for tactical entries on confirmed recovery signals.

#### Market Sentiments: 5/10

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Q1 FY26 loss (provisioning) | Negative — earnings shock and stock weakness |
| NCD Tier‑2 raise (₹500 Cr) | Positive — strengthens capital, non‑dilutive |
| Management guidance to shrink MFI | Mixed — reduces future risk but reduces near‑term yield |
| Institutional investor activity | DII accumulation; quality public investors present |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Near‑term sentiment is cautious after the rare reported loss (first since 2008), but markets have digested the transparent provisioning and capital actions.
- Capital raises (Tier‑2 / planned Tier‑1) and NCD announcement help sentiment by demonstrating access to markets.
- Broker coverage mixed: some bullish calls (Motilal Oswal) but also conservative stances (ICICI, Emkay) — markets are waiting for proof of credit‑cost normalisation.
- Sentiment will pivot on MFI recovery, provisioning trajectory and NIM stabilisation; currently neutral‑to‑cautious.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 8/10

| Holder Category | Jun'25 |
|-----------------|--------|
| Promoters | 0.00% |
| FIIs | ~16.3% |
| DIIs | ~47.13% |
| Public / Others | ~36.6% |
| Notable public investors | Ashish Dhawan (~3.86%), IFC (~2.87%) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- DIIs are strong and growing (largest bucket at ~47% Jun'25) — reflects domestic institutional conviction and stable shareholding.
- Presence of quality long‑term investors (Ashish Dhawan, IFC) is a positive signal for corporate governance and long‑term orientation.
- FIIs are meaningful (~16%) — provides liquidity and global investor interest.
- Promoter holding at 0% (post‑restructuring/merger history) means widely held stock; good institutional base reduces single‑party control risk.
- Shareholding profile is healthy and supportive for recovery / capital transactions.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE % |
|------|---------------------|-----:|---------:|------:|
| AU Small Finance | ₹55,569.7 Cr | 25.4 | 3.23 × | 14.2% |
| Ujjivan Small Finance | ₹8,282.6 Cr | 15.7 | 1.36 × | 12.4% |
| Equitas SFB | ₹5,958.0 Cr | — | 0.98 × | 2.4% |
| Jana Small Finance | ₹5,177.7 Cr | 11.9 | 1.26 × | 13.0% |
| Utkarsh Small Finance | ₹2,335.4 Cr | — | 0.79 × | 0.8% |
| Median (sample) | ₹2,335.4 Cr | 16.0 | 0.98 × | 10.4% |

- Equitas trades at a discount to higher‑quality peers (AU, Ujjivan, Jana) on both P/B and ROE — indicating re‑rating scope if profitability recovers.

## Key Strengths
- Strong deposit franchise and improving CASA (~29%) which supports cost of funds.
- Proactive management: upfront provisioning, transparent communication and clear de‑risking strategy for MFI.
- Capital access demonstrated (Tier‑2 NCD ₹500 Cr; Board approval for Tier‑1 raise) — supports growth without immediate dilution.
- Diversified secured portfolio (SBL, vehicle finance, housing) reducing single‑product concentration risk.
- Institutional investor base (DIIs, FIIs, quality public holders) provides steady demand.

## Key Concerns  
- Near‑term earnings shock: Q1 FY26 reported a loss due to large one‑off/overlay provisioning (impacting TTM PAT).
- MFI stress and state regulatory spillovers remain an execution risk until portfolio is materially shrunk and collections stay stable.
- Margin pressure: mix shift away from MFI (higher yield) to secured products and investments in growth (cost‑to‑income elevated).
- Market re‑rating depends on execution — provisioning may continue if credit worsens, delaying recovery.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹80 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Faster normalisation of MFI collections, credit costs decline sharply by H2 FY26, secured book growth accelerates >20% YoY, CASA and cost‑of‑funds improve, ABV/PBV re‑rating to ~1.5× as ROE normalises to 10–12%. Upside driven by multiple expansion from current 0.98× PB to 1.5× PB as earnings stability returns.

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹62 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management hits guidance: advances +15–16% FY26, MFI shrinks to mid‑single digits, credit cost gradually normalises by Q4 FY26, NIM stabilises around 6.8–7.0%, ABV re‑rating to ~1.15–1.2× with ROE improvement to mid‑single digits. This yields a realistic TP around ₹62 (BV ~₹53.3 × 1.16 ≈ ₹62).

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹40 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** MFI stress persists or new slippages emerge, additional provisioning required, NIM compresses further due to higher funding costs, capital dilution triggers sentiment pressure and P/B multiple falls to ~0.75×. This yields downside to ~₹40.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|---------------:|---------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹80 | +53% | Strong execution + multiple expansion; high upside but depends on fast improvement in asset quality |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹62 | +19% | Moderate recovery, management guidance achieved; meets BUY threshold (>=15% upside) |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹40 | -23% | Continued stress and multiple compression; capital/earnings deterioration |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY — realistic scenario shows ~+19% upside from current market price (₹52.24) within 12 months, which meets the stated BUY threshold (≥15% upside).
- **Risk‑Reward Assessment:** Upside (≈+19%) vs downside (≈-23%) — favourable for a medium‑term, risk‑aware investor given cheap valuation and clear management plan, but requires close monitoring of MFI credit cost trajectory and capital actions.

## Investment Recommendation

| Field | Guidance |
|-------|---------|
| Recommendation | BUY |
| Strategy Type | Recovery / turnaround-oriented (12‑18 months) |
| Entry Price Range | ₹50 — ₹56 |
| Stop Loss | ₹45 (initial tactical) |
| Target Price | ₹62 (12 months realistic); secondary target ₹80 (optimistic) |
| Position Size | Medium (2–5% of portfolio) — size for investors with moderate risk tolerance |
| Timeline | 12 months (primary), 18–24 months for full thesis realisation |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- Valuation is attractive (P/B ~0.98) and already prices in significant near‑term stress; downside is capped by book value and institutional investor base.
- Management has taken decisive and transparent steps (front‑loaded provisioning, capital measures, migration to secured lending) to accelerate credit‑cost normalisation — this increases confidence in recovery.
- Deposit strength and capital buffer allow controlled growth without excessive dependence on expensive wholesale funding.
- Key risks (persistence of MFI stress, additional provisioning, slower NIM recovery) justify a medium position and close monitoring.

## Investment Thesis
1. Equitas is executing a deliberate de‑risking of MFI exposure and rebalancing to secured retail (SBL, used vehicle, housing) — this sacrifices short‑term yield for a structurally more stable book.
2. The bank’s deposit franchise (retail deposits and rising CASA) plus access to capital markets (Tier‑2 NCD and planned Tier‑1) support growth financing without immediate equity dilution.
3. Current valuation (sub‑book) provides a margin of safety; realistic scenario of ABV re‑rating to ~1.15–1.2× supports a near‑term upside of ~15–25%.
4. Execution risk is material — recovery depends on disciplined underwriting, controlled provisioning and the MFI run‑off trajectory — but management’s upfront provisioning reduces tail risk.
5. Trade idea: accumulate on weakness with a medium position, scale into strength once quarterly indicators (credit cost, GNPA, NIM) trend towards guidance.
