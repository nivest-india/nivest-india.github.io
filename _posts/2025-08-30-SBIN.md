### Company Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Company** | State Bank of India (SBIN) |
| **Sector** | Banking & Financial Services |
| **Current Price** | ₹802 |
| **Market Cap** | ₹7,40,757 Cr |
| **Analysis Date** | 2025-08-30 |

### Industry Overview
- Indian banking is in a mid-cycle recovery with broad-based retail and SME demand; corporate credit shows selective upcycle but is more sensitive to macro/geopolitical shocks.
- System liquidity has been abundant (RBI policy actions and CRR adjustments), supporting deposit flows but keeping margin pressure due to higher deposit competition.
- Digital payments and alternate channels (UPI, mobile, APIs) are structural growth drivers; banks with scale in digital platforms capture low-cost deposits and cross-sell revenue.
- Regulation/ESG are moving targets: higher provisioning transparency, green‑finance push and Basel/CRR dynamics influence capital strategy and return profiles.
- Large public-sector banks (PSBs) now trade on a mix of value and franchise quality; investor focus is on NIM stability, PCR and the quality of retail/SME growth.

### Detailed Analysis & Scores

#### Sectoral Analysis: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Deposit market share (FY24) | 22.55% |
| Net advance share (FY24) | 19.06% |
| India loan‑growth guidance (Mgmt) | 13–15% (FY25 guidance / FY26 outlook) |
| Banking sector median P/E (peer median) | 7.2x (median from peer set) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- SBI operates in the largest domestic market with dominant deposit (~22.6%) and advance shares (~19.1%), giving scale advantages in funding and cross‑sell.
- Structural drivers (retail housing, SME credit, digital payment flows) favour large network banks; SBI’s digital reach (YONO/UPI) positions it to capture low‑cost deposits.
- Macro/regulatory environment is mixed: CRR and rate moves can compress NIMs; banks with strong treasury and fee income (like SBI) manage this risk better.
- Competitive pressure from private banks and NBFCs is real in selected segments (cards, consumer loans); SBI’s product breadth and branch network mitigate but do not eliminate the risk.
- Overall sector is attractive for scale players with good provisioning and capital; SBI benefits from both franchise and structural tailwinds.

#### Financial Strength: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CRAR (9M FY25) | 13.03% |
| CET‑1 (post QIP) | ~12.33% (post QIP pro‑forma) |
| Gross NPA (9M FY25) | 2.07% |
| Net NPA (9M FY25) | 0.53% |
| PCR (9M FY25) | 74.66% |
| Total advances (9M FY25) | ₹40,67,752 Cr |
| Total deposits (9M FY25) | ₹52,29,384 Cr |
| TTM PAT | ₹82,550 Cr |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Balance‑sheet scale and liquidity are top‑tier: very large deposit base and advances that fund growth; TTM profits and operating cash generation are strong.
- Asset quality has materially improved vs past cycles: GNPA down (≈2.07%) and NNPA low (0.53%), supported by a high provision coverage ratio (~75%).
- Capital cushion strengthened via a large QIP (₹25,000 Cr) and issuance plans (Basel III bonds), improving CET‑1 and CRAR pro‑forma and giving headroom for growth.
- Credit cost remains low (~0.4–0.5% range) and slippage ratios have moderated; however NIM pressure and potential sectoral slippages (agri/SME) remain watch‑points.
- Operating cash flows and group subsidiary earnings (insurance, cards, AMC) add to consolidated resilience; funding mix remains diversified.

#### Valuations: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price / Earnings (TTM) | 9.3x |
| Price / Book Value | 1.38x |
| Book value (per share) | ₹583 |
| Median PE (1‑yr) | ~9.2x |
| EV / EBITDA | 15.8x |

**Score Reasoning:**
- SBI trades at attractive absolute multiples for a systemically important bank: P/E ~9–10x and P/B ~1.3–1.5x — below many private‑bank historical norms.
- Relative to PSB peers the valuation is around median or slightly premium; vs large private peers (HDFC/ICICI) it is a meaningful discount, reflecting perceived margin/quality differences.
- Subsidiary value (insurance, cards, MF) is partially embedded in consolidated valuation, leaving room for re‑rating if subsidiaries unlock value or multiples expand.
- Valuation tailwinds: strong capital cushion (QIP), improving asset quality and recurring treasury/fee income; headwinds: NIM pressure and policy risk could keep multiples capped.
- Overall valuation is reasonable for a BUY at a 12‑month horizon, offering an attractive risk‑reward given balance‑sheet quality and growth visibility.

#### Growth Potential: 8/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Management loan growth guidance | 13–15% (FY25 / FY26 guidance) |
| 3‑yr Profit CAGR | ~30% |
| 5‑yr Profit CAGR | ~36% |
| Key growth engines | Retail, SME, Corporate pipeline, Subsidiaries, Treasury |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Multiple growth levers: retail mortgages and consumer, SME expansion, corporate pipeline and international footprint — management guidance of 13–15% is realistic and achievable given scale.
- Subsidiaries (SBI Life, SBI Card, SBI Mutual Fund) provide structural earnings diversification and fee income growth; consolidation and cross‑sell provide upside.
- Digital transformation (YONO, APIs, UPI share) materially enhances distribution efficiency and lowers acquisition/servicing cost; this supports higher RoA/ROE when scale benefits are realized.
- Capital raise (QIP) materially reduces capital constraint risk and enables faster credit growth without immediate dilution of prudence.
- NIM headwinds (deposit repricing) and competitive loan pricing are constraints; sustainable growth depends on controlling cost of funds and extracting fee/treasury income.

#### Corporate Governance: 7/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Promoter holding (Jul 2025) | 55.50% |
| Promoter pledge | 0.00% |
| Recent regulatory/penalty items | RBI penalty (small), local stamp duty fine (minor) |
| Major corporate actions | QIP ₹25,000 Cr (Jul 2025) |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Ownership: government promoter stake remains majority (~55–57%) — provides stability but introduces political/policy sensitivity in strategic decisions.
- Disclosure and transparency are generally high (regular analyst presentations, concalls); management guidance has been specific (loan growth, PCR, capital targets).
- No material governance scandals; low pledge and routine regulatory interactions (small penalties) have limited investor impact.
- QIP execution and capital management were well‑orchestrated (strong demand, large FII participation), reflecting strong investor confidence and disciplined execution.
- Governance score moderated by the inherent political/government ownership dimension and execution risk across large subsidiary footprint (leadership changes/efficiency drives).

#### Research Reports: 9/10

| Broker | Date | Recommendation | Target Price |
|--------|------|----------------|--------------|
| ICICI Securities | 10 Aug 2025 | BUY | ₹970 |
| Emkay | 10 Aug 2025 | BUY | ₹975 |
| Prabhudas Lilladher | 09 Aug 2025 | BUY | ₹960 |
| LKP Securities | 11 Aug 2025 | BUY | ₹908 |
| LKP (earlier) | 07 May 2025 | BUY | ₹907 |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Broad and constructive analyst coverage: multiple leading brokers (ICICI, Emkay, PL, LKP) with BUY recommendations and target prices clustered in the ₹900–975 range.
- Research consensus recognizes the QIP, strong balance sheet, and diversified subsidiaries as key positives; most models assume 12–13% credit growth and PCR ~74–76%.
- Analysts flag NIM risk and potential provision surprises as key downside scenarios; this is visible in bear/bull scenario spreads across reports.
- Strong analyst coverage increases informational clarity and reduces asymmetric information risk for investors.
- Weighted consensus target (~₹950–970) supports a BUY thesis at current levels.

#### Technical Analysis: 6/10

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Last price (close) | ₹802.50 |
| 50 DMA | ~₹809–813 |
| 200 DMA | ~₹792–793 |
| RSI (14) | 40.8 (neutral/leaning oversold) |
| Short‑term momentum | Neutral to mildly negative |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Price is trading slightly below the 50‑day average but above/broadly close to the 200‑day moving average — mixed short‑term technicals with a neutral to mildly bullish medium term base.
- Oscillators show RSI ~41 and some negative momentum indicators — there is short‑term consolidation risk but no strong technical sell signal.
- Support cluster near ₹790 and ₹770; immediate resistance in the ₹815–835 band — good risk zones for traders.
- Volume profile shows institutional participation around the QIP period and healthy liquidity; intraday volatility manageable for long‑term investors.
- Technicals are neutral: they do not negate fundamentals but suggest buying on dips or using phased entry for new positions.

#### Market Sentiments: 8/10

| Signal | Recent Evidence |
|--------|-----------------|
| Corporate action sentiment | QIP ₹25,000 Cr (Jul 2025) — strong demand, FII interest |
| News flow | Management stance on subsidiaries; S&P rating upgrade (Aug 2025) |
| Media tone | Predominantly constructive with watch on NIM/slippages |

**Score Reasoning:**
- QIP execution (oversubscribed, strong FII allocation) materially improved sentiment and validated capital strategy — a large positive catalyst for market confidence.
- Broker coverage and positive press on profitability/asset‑quality improvement have reinforced constructive sentiment.
- Management messaging (subsidiary performance reviews) shows a willingness to improve efficiency — interpreted positively by markets.
- Sentiment is tempered by macro/geopolitical risks and margin outlook; still overall market bias is positive for SBI near term.
- Investor flows (DIIs/FIIs) into the bank post‑QIP show institutional confidence, supporting the buy thesis.

#### Shareholding Pattern Analysis: 8/10

| Holder Type | Latest (Jul 2025) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Promoters | 55.50% |
| FIIs | 9.98% |
| DIIs | 27.08% |
| Public / Others | 7.30% |

**Score Reasoning:**
- Promoter holding remains majority and stable (Govt of India majority stake) — provides strategic stability while also imposing policy sensitivity.
- Institutional interest (LIC increased to ~9.49% via QIP participation; FIIs strong participation in QIP) demonstrates high‑quality investor backing.
- DIIs (mutual funds, insurance) maintain meaningful holdings and have increased participation, supporting liquidity and price stability.
- Promoter stake dilution through QIP was expected and executed transparently; no promoter pledge and strong institutional book are positives.
- Shareholding mix supports long‑term stability and reduces free‑float concentration risk.

## Peer Comparison Summary

| Name | Market Cap (Rs Cr) | P/E | CMP / BV | ROE% |
|------|--------------------|-----:|---------:|-----:|
| SBI | 740,757 | 9.32 | 1.38 | 17.2 |
| Bank of Baroda | 120,405 | 6.19 | 0.78 | 15.5 |
| Punjab National Bank | 115,941 | 6.97 | 0.84 | 15.2 |
| Canara Bank | 94,181 | 5.10 | 0.89 | 17.8 |
| Union Bank (I) | 95,283 | 5.06 | 0.84 | 17.1 |
| Median (peer set) | 80,659 | 7.19 | 1.00 | 15.35 |

## Key Strengths
- Market leadership in deposits and a very large retail distribution network (scale advantage).
- Improving asset quality with high PCR and low credit cost; diversified loan mix across retail, SME, corporate and international.
- Strong capital cushion post QIP; subsidiaries (insurance, cards, AMC) add fee and non‑interest income diversification.
- Deep digital footprint (YONO/UPI) that supports low‑cost deposit acquisition and cross‑sell; robust recurring treasury income.
- Broad analyst coverage with constructive consensus targets and institutional investor support in QIP.

## Key Concerns  
- Margin pressure (NIM compression) from deposit repricing remains the key near‑term risk to earnings.
- Government ownership introduces policy and political sensitivity for strategic decisions and compensation governance.
- Execution risk in subsidiaries and potential for higher slippages in stress sectors (agri/seasonal MSME) if macro weakens.
- Large balance‑sheet can dilute speed of nimble responses versus private peers in select high‑growth retail niches.
- Valuation upside is moderate vs some private banks; multiple expansion depends on sustained margin recovery and execution.

## Scenario Analysis

### Optimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹1,150 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Faster NIM recovery (deposit repricing eases), loan growth >15% (retail + SME acceleration), strong treasury gains, successful operational turnarounds at key subsidiaries, multiple expansion as investor confidence returns (re‑rating toward private‑peer multiples).

### Realistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹970 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Management guidance delivered (12–13% loan growth), PCR and asset quality stable, QIP capital deployed to grow advances while maintaining CET‑1 >12%, recurring fee & treasury income offset modest NIM compression — consensus broker targets cluster around this level.

### Pessimistic Scenario
**Target Price:** ₹700 (12 months)  
**Key Drivers:** Prolonged NIM compression (higher deposit costs), modest deterioration in asset quality in cyclical pockets (agri/SME), multiple contraction as market reprices banks on margin risk; earnings weaker than guided, valuation reverts closer to PSB lows.

### Scenario Summary — Target Price Analysis

| Scenario | Target Price | Return vs CMP | Recommendation Logic |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Optimistic Case** | ₹1,150 | +43% | Strong execution + multiple expansion; high reward for large allocation. |
| **Realistic Case** | ₹970 | +21% | Balanced payoff reflecting consensus analyst targets and management guidance — base case. |
| **Pessimistic Case** | ₹700 | -13% | Downside if margins and asset quality both disappoint; capital buffer mitigates deeper falls. |

**Investment Recommendation Based on Target Analysis:**
- **Primary Recommendation:** BUY (12‑month target ₹970, ≈+21% upside from CMP ₹802)  
- **Risk‑Reward Assessment:** Reward (≈+21%) > downside (≈‑13%) in base case; strong balance‑sheet and diversified income tilt the trade in favor of accumulation on dips.

## Investment Recommendation

| Recommendation | Strategy Type | Entry Price Range | Stop Loss | Target Price | Position Size | Time Horizon |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| BUY | Core / Large‑cap banking allocation | ₹760 — ₹820 | ₹720 | ₹970 (12 months) | Medium (2–5% portfolio) | 12 months |

**Recommendation Reasoning:**
- SBI combines scale, improving asset quality, and strong earnings diversification (subsidiaries + treasury + fees).  
- QIP (₹25,000 Cr) materially improves capital headroom and reduces capital constraint risk for loan growth.  
- Consolidated valuation (P/E ~9.3x, P/B ~1.4x) offers reasonable upside vs fundamentals and broker consensus targets (₹908–975).  
- Recommend phased buying (average in ₹760–820 band) to manage short‑term NIM volatility; use a ~10% stop loss to limit downside while allowing time for recovery.

## Investment Thesis
1. Franchise advantage: Market leadership in deposits & retail distribution provides persistent low‑cost funding and cross‑sell opportunities, underpinning sustainable earnings.
2. Improving asset quality + high PCR: GNPA/NNPA trend and ~75% PCR materially reduce tail risk from legacy stressed assets.
3. Capital adequacy strengthened: Large QIP and proactive capital plan give room for 12–15% credit growth without compromising CET‑1 targets.
4. Diversified earnings: Subsidiaries (insurance/cards/AMC) + recurring treasury and fee income reduce dependence on NIM and cushion margin volatility.
5. Valuation edge: Trades at reasonable multiples vs private peers and offers attractive risk‑reward if management executes on growth and margin stabilization.
